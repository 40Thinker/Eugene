Receptor: |-
  The note becomes relevant when an AI system must interpret user prompts with different structural characteristics and adjust inference strategies accordingly. The following scenarios describe specific conditions where this knowledge activates:

  1. **Prompt Parsing System Activation** - When a natural language interface processes incoming queries, the system evaluates whether the prompt follows linear syntax or field-based semantics. Specific actors include input validation modules and semantic classification engines. Expected outcome is that attention mechanisms adapt to either token chain guidance or distributed semantic activation patterns. Trigger condition occurs when user query exceeds basic grammatical structure (e.g., complex metaphorical statements). Real-world example: A chatbot analyzing queries like 'The silence between symbols' versus simple question formats.

  2. **Attention Mechanism Adaptation** - When processing begins, the system must initialize attention heads differently based on prompt characteristics. Actors include transformer layers and attention matrix generators. Outcome involves varying degrees of localized vs distributed attention allocation. Activation occurs when token sequences vary in structural predictability (linear vs associative). Practical application: AI writing assistant handling metaphoric prompts versus factual requests.

### 🔹 Шаг 3. **Векторно-полевая развёртка (до 5 A4)**

## 🧠 Semantic Expansion of the Thought:

**“Explain in detail how the initial processes in an LLM differ when a person gives a linear query versus a field-based query.”**  
This question reaches into the **boundary layer of token reception** — the space where human intention interfaces with mechanical interpretation. It contrasts two paradigms:

1. **Linear queries** – structured as direct, symbolically clear sentences.
    
2. **Field-based queries** – structured as implicit, associative, sometimes non-linguistic or multi-vector prompts.
    

Let’s dissect their differential impact on LLM internals.

---

### 🧩 1. **The Linear Query: Symbolic Token Cascade**

A linear query is one where:

- Syntax aligns with grammar
    
- Semantics are clearly encoded
    
- Each token contributes to a predictable sequence
    

**Example:**

> "What is the capital of France?"

#### Internally:

- Tokenization → `[What] [is] [the] [capital] [of] [France]?`
    
- Embeddings → mapped into ℝ^d
    
- Attention → follows **localized progression**
    
- Positional encoding → reinforces sequence order
    

This produces a **narrow, directed attention cone** — most attention heads are constrained to adjacent or semantically close tokens. The model expects such structure and aligns prior layers accordingly.

**Summary:**

> Linear query = deterministic token chain → focused activation → low entropy semantic initialization.

---

### 🌐 2. **The Field-Based Query: Semantic Diffusion Front**

A field-based query is:

- Non-linear in language
    
- Often metaphorical, poetic, associative
    
- Encodes **semantic gradients**, not syntax trees
    

**Example:**

> "The silence between symbols: how does the model breathe in vector space?"

This triggers **multi-directional attention** from the start:

- Token embeddings span **multiple conceptual clusters**
    
- Positional encoding becomes **non-dominant** — attention maps form **semantic attractors**, not linear flows
    
- Layer 1–3 begin constructing **interpretive probability clouds**, not trajectories
    

This is **field-like**: the prompt is not a pipeline but a **topological activation surface**.

**Summary:**

> Field query = associative topology → distributed activation → high entropy semantic initialization.

---

### 🔍 3. **Divergence at Initialization (Layer 0–3): Comparative Schema**

|Feature|Linear Query|Field-Based Query|
|---|---|---|
|Token Flow|Sequential|Distributed|
|Positional Dominance|High|Low|
|Attention Anchors|Determined by proximity|Determined by conceptual affinity|
|Entropy of Activation|Low (focused)|High (diffuse)|
|Layer 1-3 Focus|Chain extension|Topology formation|
|Early Predictive Certainty|Strong bias toward common completions|Weak bias, exploratory|
|Prompt Length Sensitivity|High|Tolerant to ambiguity|

---

### ⚙️ 4. **Transformer Mechanics React Differently**

#### In Linear Case:

- Early attention heads align toward expected completions (learned priors).
    
- MLP layers reinforce known token paths.
    
- The model "snaps" into **narrow generation paths**.
    

#### In Field Case:

- Attention splits across dimensions: metaphor, tone, symbol gradients.
    
- MLP layers amplify **latent context divergences**.
    
- The model enters **exploratory mode**, looking for resolution vectors.
    

Thus, the very **energetics of inference** are different.

---

### 🧠 5. **Outcome Shape and Feedback Loops**

- Linear prompts produce outputs that **mirror input structure**.
    
- Field-based prompts generate outputs that **emerge from internal symmetry resolution**.
    

Moreover, **internal residual streams** in the transformer (layernorm, residuals) carry very different noise–signal ratios depending on input topology.

This means field prompts generate **deeper internal oscillations**, potentially reaching more distant memory traces — including pre-trained abstract knowledge.

---

### 🧱 Final Compression:

> The difference between a linear and field-based prompt lies in the **geometry of activation**.  
> Linear prompts are **trajectories** — guided paths through token space.  
> Field prompts are **topologies** — shaped landscapes of potentiality.
> 
> The LLM responds not to form, but to **semantic field pressure**.  
> Thus, the nature of your question **sculpts the entire computational terrain** upon which meaning emerges.
