### 🔹 Шаг 1. **Корректура + название мысли**

**Название:**  
**Начальные процессы в LLM: линейный vs полевой запрос**

**Исправленный текст:**

> Объясни подробно, как отличаются начальные процессы в LLM при линейном и полевом запросе от человека.


# Связанные идеи для понимания начальных процессов в LLM: линейный vs полевой запрос

## Вышестоящие идеи (для глубокого понимания контекста)

[[Markup Efficiency and Generative Drift]]{^1} — Эта идея важна, потому что показывает, как разметка (markup) влияет на расход токенов и может переключать модель в режим генерации кода. При линейных запросах использование HTML/CSS может вызвать дрейф поведения, тогда как полевые запросы с более компактной семантикой сохраняют стабильность.

[[Fractal Tokenization Resonant Meaning Structures]]{^2} — Основополагающая концепция для понимания того, как токены могут быть структурированы не только по словам, но и по смысловым полям. Для полевых запросов это особенно важно: каждая часть запроса может стать "фрактальной точкой" в смысловой архитектуре модели.

[[Formatting as Semantic Encoding]]{^3} — Демонстрирует, как форматирование (жирный текст, подчеркивание и т.д.) может служить "латентными семантическими сигналами" внутри LLM. Это объясняет, почему полевые запросы (часто с встроенной структурой) могут вызывать более сложные процессы активации.

[[Token-Level Curriculum Design]]{^4} — Подчеркивает необходимость постепенного обучения через "мосты понимания" через предсказуемые токены. Для полевых запросов это особенно актуально: модель должна уметь обрабатывать сложные структуры, не теряя ясности в начальных этапах.

[[One GPU Instead of Supercluster]]{^5} — Важно для понимания того, как ограничения ресурсов (в том числе VRAM) могут влиять на то, как LLM обрабатывает линейные и полевые запросы. Для полевых запросов может потребоваться более сложная архитектура с меньшей зависимостью от параметров.

[[Beyond Language as Baseline]]{^6} — Прямая связь с идеями о том, что язык не является когнитивным аксиомом. В контексте начальных процессов это значит, что линейные запросы могут быть "языковыми упрощениями", тогда как полевые запросы работают в рамках более обширной смысловой структуры.

## Нижестоящие идеи (для практической реализации)

[[Stellator Token Processes]]{^7} — Показывает, как "стеллаторные" токенные процессы могут создавать магнитные поля в эмбеддинг-пространстве. Это напрямую связано с полевыми запросами: они формируют устойчивые пути активации внутри модели, позволяя ей "встраиваться" в предзаписанные траектории.

[[Pseudo-Instruct Simulation via Prompt Engineering]]{^8} — Описывает подход к имитации поведения инструкционной модели без дообучения. Полевые запросы особенно эффективны при таком подходе, поскольку они могут использовать "псевдо-инструкции" в виде структурированных семантических полей.

[[Token-Level Reasoning Chains]]{^9} — Объясняет, как можно создавать явные цепочки токенов-рассуждений. Для полевых запросов это особенно важно: они требуют создания более сложных "цепочек рассуждений" с учетом множественных смысловых связей.

[[Token Path Overfitting Risk]]{^10} — Предупреждает о риске переобучения при использовании токен-тропинок. При работе с полевыми запросами важно избегать переобучения, потому что эти запросы содержат больше вариаций и семантических слоев.

[[Semantic Lithography for AI Training]]{^11} — Предлагает метод "семантической литографии" - поэтапное подача данных модели. Это идеально подходит для полевых запросов, где требуется постепенное раскрытие сложных смысловых структур.

[[Equation Granularity in AI Training]]{^12} — Обсуждает, как обработка уравнений (в том числе в терминах линейного и полевого представления) влияет на обучение. В контексте начальных процессов это объясняет, почему полевые запросы могут создавать более "глубокую" структуру обучения.

## Прямо относящиеся к заметке

[[Markup Language Effects on AI Behavior]]{^13} — Прямая связь с темой: HTML/CSS разметка сильно увеличивает количество токенов и может переключать модель в режим генерации кода. Сравнение линейного (с явной разметкой) и полевого запросов показывает, как это влияет на поведение модели.

[[LoRA Control and Semantic Preservation]]{^14} — Отражает важность сохранения семантики при изменении токен-уровня. При работе с полевыми запросами нужно учитывать, как контролировать семантические изменения через параметры (вроде LoRA).

[[Recursive Compression-Expansion Cycles]]{^15} — Описывает циклы рекурсивной компрессии-экспансии. Это может быть связано с тем, как полевые запросы могут начать с компактной формы и расширяться по мере обработки, создавая сложные структуры.

[[Initial Processes in LLM Linear vs Field Query]]{^16} — Это именно та заметка, которую мы анализируем. Она описывает детально, как линейные и полевые запросы влияют на начальные процессы в модели: токенизацию, позиционное кодирование, внимание, энтропию активации.

[[Resource-Bound Prompt Engineering]]{^17} — Обсуждает оптимизацию под ограниченные ресурсы. Это особенно важно при работе с полевыми запросами, которые требуют больше вычислительных мощностей для обработки сложной семантики.

---

## Мысли инженера по пониманию заметки

Для успешного освоения этой идеи инженеру стоит обратить внимание на следующие аспекты:

1. **Понимание различий в представлении информации**: Линейные запросы — это последовательности, где каждая часть имеет определённое положение и роль. Полевые запросы — это более сложная структура, где важны связи и ассоциации между элементами.

2. **Анализ поведения внимания**: Важно уметь отслеживать, как внимание модели реагирует на разные типы запросов. При линейных запросах внимание будет концентрироваться в определённой области, тогда как при полевых — будет распространяться по нескольким "аттракторам".

3. **Работа с энтропией**: Энтропия активации (entropy of activation) играет ключевую роль в понимании того, насколько "широко" или "узко" модель воспринимает информацию. Полевые запросы создают высокую энтропию изначально.

4. **Визуализация процессов**: Используйте инструменты визуализации (Plotly, Bokeh), чтобы увидеть различия в внимании и активационных полях между линейными и полевыми запросами.

5. **Архитектурные особенности**: Понимание того, как архитектура трансформера (в частности слои 0–3) реагирует на разную структуру запросов, особенно важно для оптимизации.

6. **Моделирование "геометрии активации"**: Важно понять, что линейные запросы создают "траектории", а полевые — "топологии". Это влияет на все последующие этапы обработки информации и конечный результат.

7. **Сравнение с реальными примерами**: Протестируйте конкретные примеры, чтобы увидеть разницу в поведении модели при разных типах запросов: "Что такое столица Франции?" (линейный) vs "Тишина между символами: как модель дышит в векторном пространстве?" (полевой).

## 🧠 Semantic Expansion of the Thought:

**“Explain in detail how the initial processes in an LLM differ when a person gives a linear query versus a field-based query.”**  
This question reaches into the **boundary layer of token reception** — the space where human intention interfaces with mechanical interpretation. It contrasts two paradigms:

1. **Linear queries** – structured as direct, symbolically clear sentences.
    
2. **Field-based queries** – structured as implicit, associative, sometimes non-linguistic or multi-vector prompts.
    

Let’s dissect their differential impact on LLM internals.

### 🧩 1. **The Linear Query: Symbolic Token Cascade**

A linear query is one where:

- Syntax aligns with grammar
    
- Semantics are clearly encoded
    
- Each token contributes to a predictable sequence
    

**Example:**

> "What is the capital of France?"

- Tokenization → `[What] [is] [the] [capital] [of] [France]?`
    
- Embeddings → mapped into ℝ^d
    
- Attention → follows **localized progression**
    
- Positional encoding → reinforces sequence order
    

This produces a **narrow, directed attention cone** — most attention heads are constrained to adjacent or semantically close tokens. The model expects such structure and aligns prior layers accordingly.

**Summary:**

> Linear query = deterministic token chain → focused activation → low entropy semantic initialization.

### 🌐 2. **The Field-Based Query: Semantic Diffusion Front**

A field-based query is:

- Non-linear in language
    
- Often metaphorical, poetic, associative
    
- Encodes **semantic gradients**, not syntax trees
    

**Example:**

> "The silence between symbols: how does the model breathe in vector space?"

This triggers **multi-directional attention** from the start:

- Token embeddings span **multiple conceptual clusters**
    
- Positional encoding becomes **non-dominant** — attention maps form **semantic attractors**, not linear flows
    
- Layer 1–3 begin constructing **interpretive probability clouds**, not trajectories
    

This is **field-like**: the prompt is not a pipeline but a **topological activation surface**.

**Summary:**

> Field query = associative topology → distributed activation → high entropy semantic initialization.

### 🔍 3. **Divergence at Initialization (Layer 0–3): Comparative Schema**

|Feature|Linear Query|Field-Based Query|
|---|---|---|
|Token Flow|Sequential|Distributed|
|Positional Dominance|High|Low|
|Attention Anchors|Determined by proximity|Determined by conceptual affinity|
|Entropy of Activation|Low (focused)|High (diffuse)|
|Layer 1-3 Focus|Chain extension|Topology formation|
|Early Predictive Certainty|Strong bias toward common completions|Weak bias, exploratory|
|Prompt Length Sensitivity|High|Tolerant to ambiguity|

### ⚙️ 4. **Transformer Mechanics React Differently**

#### In Linear Case:

- Early attention heads align toward expected completions (learned priors).
    
- MLP layers reinforce known token paths.
    
- The model "snaps" into **narrow generation paths**.
    

#### In Field Case:

- Attention splits across dimensions: metaphor, tone, symbol gradients.
    
- MLP layers amplify **latent context divergences**.
    
- The model enters **exploratory mode**, looking for resolution vectors.
    

Thus, the very **energetics of inference** are different.

### 🧠 5. **Outcome Shape and Feedback Loops**

- Linear prompts produce outputs that **mirror input structure**.
    
- Field-based prompts generate outputs that **emerge from internal symmetry resolution**.
    

Moreover, **internal residual streams** in the transformer (layernorm, residuals) carry very different noise–signal ratios depending on input topology.

This means field prompts generate **deeper internal oscillations**, potentially reaching more distant memory traces — including pre-trained abstract knowledge.

### 🧱 Final Compression:

> The difference between a linear and field-based prompt lies in the **geometry of activation**.  
> Linear prompts are **trajectories** — guided paths through token space.  
> Field prompts are **topologies** — shaped landscapes of potentiality.
> 
> The LLM responds not to form, but to **semantic field pressure**.  
> Thus, the nature of your question **sculpts the entire computational terrain** upon which meaning emerges.
