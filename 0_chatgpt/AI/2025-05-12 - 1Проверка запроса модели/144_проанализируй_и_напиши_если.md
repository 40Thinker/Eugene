>  2. Requirements for a new type of aviation. 
>  The reasons for the stupid trampling of aviation in place for 50 years:
> 1. Modern aviation really began to be created only after the scientific foundations for creating lift and flight were developed. These fundamentals are based on classical stationary aerodynamics. 
> 2. For a hundred years, thousands of designers have designed aircraft according to the classical scheme and at the same time tried to give birth to something new. They have not yet given birth to anything significantly new because: 
> 2.1. Modern scientists and designers do not pay attention to the fact that when creating a new high-performance aircraft, scientific work must first be carried out to search for fundamentally new physical phenomena to create force and solve problems of aerodynamic drag. 
> 2.2. Until now, all aviation is based on the creation of thrust due to the gradient of the amount of movement (jet theory). All scientists and designers hold onto propellers such as propellers, turbines, etc. They do not know anything else.
> 2.3. They don't know,
>  
>  3. Overview of the flying umbrella type.
>  3.1. Degen aircraft (Austria). 
>  Two hundred years ago, an Austrian watchmaker made an aircraft consisting of an aerostat (with a lifting aerostatic force of about 40 kg) and two umbrella-shaped bodies driven into vertical vibrations from human feet.
> 
>  
>  
>  The umbrella had 1200 valves and when moving up, they opened, and when moving down, they closed. An additional aerodynamic force was formed and the person on the device rose up and flew. 
>  3.2. Chance Wootom's apparatus (1911, USA).
>  The "umbrella" jerks up and down, and when it moves down, the device even separates from the ground for a second. The umbrella plane (it was called the umbrella plane) was tested in 1911 in America by the inventor Chance Wout. Chance Wout tried out several cars and meticulously filmed all models. 
>  
> 
>  Chance Wout tried out several cars and meticulously filmed all models. The principle of flight, based on the creation of a seal under a vibrating plane, is no worse than what is used in traditional aircraft. And, you must agree, the very fact of the material costs of creating such a device is very indicative: the engineers felt that it was possible to get significant lifting force on this path. Gradually, during the tests, it became clear that it was enough to make the oscillation frequency megahertz, and the amplitude of the oscillations millimeter – and the device became capable of flight. However, at that time there were no technologies that allowed using vibration at full power to provide an ultrasonic frequency. 
>  3.3. Tatarinov's umbrella (1912, Russia). 
> The umbrella wavered from the shots of the revolver. Due to the difference in aerodynamic resistances during the movement of the umbrella up and down, an average lifting force was formed. 
>  
> 
>  3.4. Flying machine with vibrating elements.
> 
>  
> 
>  The device did not take off. 
>  3.5. Zvukolet. 
>  A large surface was oscillating, which emitted acoustic waves. 
> 
>  
>  
>  It was planned that the device would take off from the pressure of acoustic waves. The device did not take off. 
>  3.6. Victor Schauberger's Repulsin engine.
> 
>  
> 	
>  Victor Schauberger is an Austrian naturalist, discoverer of self-sustaining dynamic flows. The Repulsin Schauberger engine, on the basis of which the Belonce disk was created, consumed only water and air, and its principle of operation included Implosion. 
>  3.7. Flying machine GFS Projects (England). 
>  English researchers from GFS Projects have created their own unmanned flying vehicle with the capabilities of a flying saucer (in the conventional sense) – it takes off vertically from any surface and can land anywhere, and if it accidentally collides with any object, then there will be no explosion. 
>  
>  
> 
>  The lifting force in the apparatus was formed due to the Coanda effect (the formation of reduced pressure on the upper part of the umbrella-shaped dome). The developers say that such a "plate" is much more convenient than helicopters – it is more stable and easy to operate. 
>  3.8. The aircraft of the company Festo (Germany). 
> The device consists of an aerostatic balloon and 8 hinged rods with oscillating wings at the ends. 
>  
> 
>  The device flew slowly, but very beautifully. 
>  3.9. Conclusions. 
> 1. There are a lot of proposals to create a device in the form of an umbrella or a flying saucer. The above is an overview of only those devices that were manufactured and some even flew.
>  2. The most successful experience was obtained by Degen 200 years ago (he successfully flew). It is not clear why no one continued and developed his success? 
> 3. The practical use of the devices did not occur due to the very low lifting force received from the unit of drive power.
>  4. All developments were carried out on the basis of stationary aerodynamics and at the inventive level. Therefore, economical umbrella-shaped devices were not created. The development of umbrella-shaped apparatuses with oscillating working bodies based on the physical processes of oscillatory aerodynamics could allow the creation of highly economical apparatuses. But oscillatory aerodynamics remains very poorly understood. And many researchers and developers ignore to study it.
> 5. The apparatus with oscillating working organs is necessary
> 
>  4. Our suggestions. 
>  Based on the results we have obtained, it is possible to create a new type of aviation that will solve all transport problems. We experimentally investigated the mechanical, kinematic, dynamic and energy characteristics of an oscillating plate as a propulsive device. And we found modes in which the specific thrust was more than 200 kG / hp!!! Based on the application of our results (see sections 1-3), we propose, instead of today's aviation ("flying locomotives"), to start creating a new highly efficient aviation: - an umbrella helicopter with a specific lifting force of 80 kG / hp (this is 20 times more than helicopters have) and a speed of up to 400 km / h; for The umbrella is an apparatus similar to a helicopter, only the lifting force and forward thrust force is formed not by the rotation of the main rotor, but with the help of twelve wings oscillating at the bottom of the dome-shaped shell.

>  Now unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are produced by more than 350 companies (aircraft and helicopter versions).
>

> Despite their very poor characteristics, they are massively bought, because there are no better ones, and they are very much needed. But for consumers, UAVs with much better characteristics are needed: - vertical takeoff and descent, highly maneuverable; - high specific lifting force; - cheap; - reliable; - several times larger payload; - high speed, range and altitude. Due to the high consumer demand, there are now more than 400 companies in the world that produce drones of the traditional scheme (airplane, helicopter). All these drones have very poor characteristics, but they are bought because there are no other better ones. This work will be a dress rehearsal before the creation of a new type of aircraft with different carrying capacities. Already these devices of ours will have a huge demand and will displace the products of existing firms. According to the state of the UAV market, most aircraft adopt the technologies of traditional large aircraft, which obviously determines

The selection of aviation for these purposes is not an easy task. We offer the delivery of containers to be carried out with the help of umbrella helicopters (up to 1000 km) or wingships (for very long distances, up to 15,000 km).

>  The cost of zontflights and the cost of the flight will be several times cheaper compared to today's aviation. We are looking for investors and partners to create a new type of highly economical and maneuverable aircraft with an oscillatory type propulsion. Organizational structure of work execution: 1. R&D with the delivery of the first industrial samples is carried out in LLC "Vortex Oscillating Technologies".

> Мой путь к пониманию физических основ оказался иным: он начался не с Ваших статей, а с системного анализа проблем аэродинамики, граничных течений и неразрешённых противоречий в уравнениях Навье–Стокса, а также — с работы над ИИ-архитектурой, основанной на онтологической физике.
