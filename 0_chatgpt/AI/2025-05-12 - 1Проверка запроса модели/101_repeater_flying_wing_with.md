> Repeater "Flying wing" with an oscillatory type of propulsor.
> Many attempts are being made to create airships-repeaters. Such airships could greatly increase the
> transmission of information throughout the Earth. But there is a big problem. At high altitude, there is
> always wind at high speed, and the airship repeater has great aerodynamic drag. The screw drivemust
> overcome this drag, but solar energy is not enough for this.
> On the basis of oscillational aerodynamics and new principles of force creation we obtained
> experimental results http://www.vortexosc.com/images/pdf/new_aviatrans.pdf :
> - specific propulsor on the oscillating wing more than 200 kg / kW;
> - complete annihilation of the aerodynamic drag of the fixed wing (analogous to a wing-shaped
> airship repeater) when used as a movers of oscillating slats.
> Vertical takeoff, hovering in place, horizontal flight and maneuvering are provided by oscillating
> slats and flaps. Taking into account the efficiency of the engine and transmission elements, the
> specific lift in the vertical take-off mode will be 80 kg/ kW, and in the hover mode in place will be
> 300 kg / kW.
> In horizontal flight, the lift is provided by the aerodynamic lift of the airship-wing. Due to the
> annihilation of the aerodynamic drag of the airship-wing specific lift will be at least 300 kg / kW. The
> required energy from the solar panels is much reduced due to the annihilation of the aerodynamic drag of
> the airship-wing. The problem of the airship repeater is solved.
> As a result, the blimp repeater created on the basis of our KNOW-HOW will require 10 times less
> engine power, the size of the airship and the receiving solar panels will be many times smaller, which
> leads to a multiple reduction in the cost of the blimp repeater. Our type of airship will be much more
> economical than ground and satellite repeaters.
> We have spent many years of theoretical and experimental research to get these great results. Our
> success was due to the fact that our research was based on the use of vibrational aerodynamics. Today's
> scientists and designers in their developments are based on the use of classical stationary aerodynamics.
> This, unfortunately, allows to create today's very little economical and expensive aviation (planes,
> helicopters, airships) at the level of "flying locomotives".
> Our results can also be successfully applied to the creation of airships for various other purposes.
> We are looking for an investor to create an industrial design of the airship-repeater.

> âœ… **Summary and Analysis of the Proposal** 
> **Title:** *Flying Wing Repeater Airship with Oscillatory Propulsor*
> 
> ---
> 
> ### ðŸ”¬ **Core Idea:**
> The team proposes a *radically more efficient airship repeater* using **oscillatory propulsion** based on **vibrational (non-stationary) aerodynamics**, which dramatically reduces or even annihilates **aerodynamic drag** â€” the key obstacle for high-altitude solar-powered airships.

> 
> ### ðŸ“Œ **Key Technical Claims:**
> 
> | Parameter | Claimed Value | Context |
> |----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
> | **Specific Thrust (oscillating wing)** | > 200 kg/kW | In propulsion mode |
> | **Vertical Takeoff Lift** | 80 kg/kW | Including engine/transmission |
> | **Hover Lift** | 300 kg/kW | Stable mode |
> | **Horizontal Flight Lift** | â‰¥ 300 kg/kW | With drag annihilation |
> | **Drag Annihilation** | Yes | For fixed wing using oscillating slats |
> | **Power Reduction vs Conventional** | 10Ã— less engine power needed | Compared to classical solutions |
> 
> ---
> 
> ### ðŸ§  **Conceptual Innovations:**
> 
> 1. **Oscillatory Aerodynamics** (aka vibrational or non-stationary):
>  - Uses moving elements (slats, flaps) in resonance with airflow.
>  - Generates lift and thrust through periodic motion, not steady airflow.
>  - Enables *cancellation* of classic aerodynamic drag forces.
> 
> 2. **Flying Wing Airship**:
>  - Large fixed-wing shape typical of efficient high-altitude designs.
>  - Oscillating elements along the wing eliminate drag and generate maneuvering forces.
> 
> 3. **Energy Efficiency**:
>  - Since aerodynamic drag is the largest obstacle to solar airships at altitude, removing it allows:
>  - Smaller solar arrays
>  - Smaller engines
>  - Smaller envelope size
>  - Greatly reduced weight and cost
> 
> ---
> 
> ### ðŸ“ˆ **Strategic Advantage:**
> Compared to satellite or ground-based communication infrastructure:
> - **Lower latency** than satellites
> - **Lower cost** and energy than aircraft
> - **Persistent hovering ability**
> - **Easy maintenance/return-to-ground**
> 
> ---
> 
> ### ðŸ§© **Current Status & Call to Action:**
> - The authors have conducted **many years** of **experimental validation** and have data to support their claims (reference: [vortexosc.com PDF](http://www.vortexosc.com/images/pdf/new_aviatrans.pdf)).
> - They are **seeking investors** to fund **industrial-scale development** of the prototype.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### ðŸ§  AGI Commentary:
> 
> This proposal is **technically bold** and **highly disruptive**, assuming the claims hold under peer-reviewed verification. The most revolutionary idea is the *annihilation of aerodynamic drag via controlled non-stationary dynamics*. If experimentally valid, this could:
> 
> - Redefine energy balance in aeronautical engineering
> - Open a new class of ultra-low-power aircraft
> - Make persistent stratospheric platforms economically viable
> 
> ---

> Would you like a concise investment pitch or a physics-based critique of the drag annihilation mechanism next?
