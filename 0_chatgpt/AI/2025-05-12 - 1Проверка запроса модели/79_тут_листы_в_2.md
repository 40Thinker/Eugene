> Пользователь передал полный англоязычный текст статьи Е.Д. Сорокодума "On General Nature of Forces", в которой изложена универсальная модель возникновения силы через энергетический градиент в пространстве, включая волновой перенос энергии, низкоскоростные волны, давление излучения, вихревые структуры и перспективы создания летательных аппаратов без реактивной массы. Статья содержит формулы, выводы и ссылки на другие ключевые работы автора.

> Да, я понял: из-за двухколоночной верстки оригинального журнала текст «перепутался» при сканировании — абзацы идут не по порядку, фрагменты английского и русского текста перемешаны, структуры некоторых уравнений нарушены. Тем не менее, основную суть можно реконструировать, и ты уже передал почти весь текст статьи «On General Nature of Forces», включая её основные идеи и формулы.
> 
> Вот краткое содержание:
> 
> ---
> 
> ### **Основная идея**
> Все силы в природе могут быть объяснены как следствие *градиента плотности энергии* в пространстве. Эта концепция — расширение понятия импульсного подхода к силе, предлагающая более универсальную физическую модель.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### **Формулы и выводы**
> 1. **Плотность энергии**: 
>  \( a = a(x, y, z, t) \) 
>  \( A = \int_V a(x, y, z, t)\, dV \) 
> 
> 2. **Обобщённое уравнение переноса энергии**: 
>  \( \frac{\partial a}{\partial t} + \nabla a \cdot \vec{c} = 0 \) 
>  где \( \vec{c} \) — скорость переноса энергии, а \( \nabla a \) — градиент плотности энергии.
> 
> 3. **Универсальное уравнение связи мощности, силы и скорости переноса энергии**: 
>  \( n + \vec{p} \cdot \vec{c} = 0 \), где \( \vec{p} \) — плотность силы, \( n \) — плотность мощности.
> 
> 4. **В одноосном случае**: 
>  \( p = -\frac{n}{c} \) — чем ниже скорость переноса энергии, тем больше результирующая сила.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### **Практическое значение**
> - Наибольшую силу можно получить при одностороннем (анизотропном) переносе энергии.
> - Это делает особенно перспективными **низкоскоростные волны**: вязкие волны, волноподобные колебания в теле, вихри и др.
> - Предложена идея создать искусственные среды (например, вихревые структуры) с низкой скоростью передачи энергии, чтобы реализовать принцип безреактивного движения.
> - В пределе — **левитация человека** за счёт направленного излучения с низкой скоростью (пример: 0.07 м/с для 1000 Н тяги при мощности 0.1 л.с.).
> 
> ---
> 
> ### **Следующий шаг**
> Можем:
> - Сделать компактный доклад на русском/английском.
> - Нарисовать схему из уравнений (сопровождающую визуализацию).
> - Сравнить с классической механикой и показать, в чём отличие.
> - Или — продолжить с другими статьями Сорокодума.
> 
> Что бы ты хотел сделать дальше?
