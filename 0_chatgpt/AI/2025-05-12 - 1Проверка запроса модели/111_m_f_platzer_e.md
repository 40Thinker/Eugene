> 1 INTRODUCTION
> Wavy air and water flow is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature, which has many interesting facets.
> Here we concentrate on a phenomenon, which was first discovered in 1922 by Katzmayr [1] who
> published a paper in the journal Zeitschrift fuer Flugtechnik und Motorluftschiffahrt titled “Effect of
> periodic changes of angle of attack on behavior of airfoils.” In this paper, he describes the tests he
> performed in the low speed wind tunnel of the Technical University of Vienna, Austria. He mounted
> an airfoil in the open test section while subjecting the air stream to periodic oscillations. Measurement
> of the lift and drag values led him to the conclusion that (his words) “the effect of flowing air, whose
> direction is undergoing constant periodic changes, is extraordinarily favorable on airfoils”.
> It is the purpose of our paper to explain the physics of the Katzmayr effect in more detail, to
> describe the major past attempts to exploit this effect for aircraft and ship propulsion purposes, and
> to draw attention to the design of future propulsion systems based on the Katzmayr effect.
> 2 KATZMAYR’S EXPERIMENT
> The experiment was performed in the Eiffel-type free-jet wind tunnel of the Aero-dynamics Laboratory
> of the Technical University of Vienna. The flow was oscillated periodically by oscillating a number
> of inlet guide vanes. Three different airfoils were tested, namely a Goettingen G189, a Goettingen
> G413 and a LA109 airfoil, by mounting them vertically in the vertical air stream and measuring
> lift and drag with a mechanical balance. The airfoil chord was 150 mm, the airfoil span 900 mm.
> All the tests were made at wind speeds corresponding to a pressure of 20 mm of water, i.e. 196 Pa.
> The frequency of oscillation of the air stream was varied from 27 to 50 oscillations/min and the
> amplitude could be varied to 12.5°. This corresponds to Strouhal numbers (based on frequency times
> chord divided by wind speed) of 0.005–0.0075. Figure 1 gives the measured drag polar of the G413
> airfoil (reproduced from reference 1). It is seen that there is a substantial drag reduction and even
> a net thrust in the lower lift range compared with the airfoil in a non-oscillating flow.
> 3 THE PHYSICS OF THRUST GENERATION DUE TO A TIME-VARYING
> ANGLE OF ATTACK
> The basic physics becomes clear by looking at Fig. 2. Whenever there is a change in angle of attack
> due to the wavy flow a starting vortex is shed from the trailing edge of the airfoil. Therefore,
> the airfoil sheds counterclockwise vorticity as long as it experiences an increase in angle of attack,

> followed by clockwise vorticity during the period of decreasing angle of attack. As a result, a vortex
> street is being generated downstream of the airfoil, which induces a velocity increase between the
> two rows. The same phenomenon occurs if the airfoil is oscillated in a uniform flow. In Fig. 2, we
> show a visualization by Jones et al. [2] of the flow downstream of a NACA 0012 airfoil, which
> oscillates with a certain frequency and amplitude in a heave (plunge) mode. Measurements of the
> time-averaged velocity downstream of the trailing edge indeed yield the jet-like velocity profile
> shown in Fig. 2. An airfoil oscillating in a heave mode or an airfoil in an oscillatory flow therefore
> generates a certain amount of thrust, which depends on the frequency and amplitude of the motion
> or on the wavelength and amplitude of the wavy flow. Thrust generation is not limited to heave
> oscillations, but occurs also for pitch oscillations or combined heave and pitch oscillations.
> This effect has been studied quite extensively over the past few years both experimentally and
> computationally. The most recent information has been published by Platzer and Jones [3] and
> by Heathcote and Gursul [4]. Much less information is available for the case of a stationary airfoil
> in a wavy flow, which is the topic of our paper.
> 4 SCHMIDT’S WAVE PROPELLER
> This feature of thrust generation due to wavy flow, first demonstrated by Katzmayr, appears to have
> attracted immediate interest. Toussaint et al. [5] in France confirmed Katzmayr’s experiment in 1924M.F. Platzer & E. Sorokodum, Int. J. of Design & Nature and Ecodynamics. Vol. 3, No. 2 (2008)

> and Stamer [6] took out a German patent in the same year, wherein he proposed a tandem configuration
> such that the forewing was forced to flap in order to generate a wavy flow (and thrust). He argued
> that the stationary rear wing then generated additional thrust and thus increased the propulsive
> efficiency of the two wings. In 1942, Schmidt and Reichstein [7] investigated this effect in more
> detail. Schmidt [8, 9] then proceeded to further develop this configuration, which he called
> wave propeller, evaluated it in wind tunnel tests, and proposed its use on catamaran boats and on air
> ships [10, 11]. A schematic of the wave propeller is shown in Fig. 3. The forward airfoil moves along
> a circle while maintaining the same incidence angle. Schmidt found this mechanism preferable to a
> pure up and down flapping motion because it allowed him to drive the forward airfoil at a higher
> frequency than possible with a pure flapping airfoil.
> Schmidt [11] proposed to apply this type of wave propeller to the design of a helium-filled airship,
> which is capable of lifting and transporting heavy loads without changing the gas volume if it is
> equipped with forward, rearward and side-mounted wave propellers to give it adequate stability and
> maneuverability in gusty air. Figure 4 depicts the prototype built by Schmidt.
> 5 EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS OF THE WAVE PROPELLER
> AERO/HYDRODYNAMICS
> Schmidt performed detailed whirl arm experiments, which provided him with thrust data for
> his wave propeller by systematically investigating the effect of amplitude and frequency and the
> geometrical configuration. This information is published in references [8, 9].112 M.F. Platzer & E. Sorokodum, Int. J. of Design & Nature and Ecodynamics. Vol. 3, No. 2 (2008)

> More recently, Sorokodum [12] performed measurements where he generated a wavy flow by
> means of a sinusoidally pitching wing (NACA 0015, chord of 0.2 m, span of 0.37 m) in front of a
> stationary wing held at zero incidence (NACA 0015, chord of 1 m, span of 0.37 m). The distance
> between the oscillating and the stationary wing was 0.45 m. The experiments were made in a water
> flow of 2.7 m/s. The amplitude of the pitching wing varied from 40° at low Strouhal numbers to
> 20° at Strouhal numbers of 0.5 and decreasing further to 9° at the highest Strouhal number tested.
> The results are shown in Fig. 5.

> F ⋅ r ⋅U 2
> where f is the oscillation frequency and L is the wing chord length, U is the flow speed, Px is the

> r is the water density. The results show the rapid decrease in drag from the steady flow value at
> St = 0, f = 0, to a net thrust at Strouhal numbers from St = 0.7 to 2.0, corresponding to frequencies of
> f = 0.6–5 Hz.
> 6 COMPUTATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS OF THE WAVE PROPELLER
> AERO/HYDRODYNAMICS
> The first computational investigation of the interference effects between two oscillating airfoils in
> tandem arrangement was carried out by Bosch [13] by means of inviscid incompressible linearized
> flow theory. He showed that a harmonically flapping airfoil upstream of a stationary airfoil increases
> the propulsive efficiency to almost 100%, thus confirming that the hind wing can indeed be used to
> convert the energy of the vortices shed from the forewing into additional thrust. Bosch’s analysis is
> limited to flat-plate airfoils oscillating about a zero-incidence mean position. Lan [14] extended
> this inviscid linearized flow analysis to finite-span flat-plate wings using lifting-surface theory.
> He concluded that it is advantageous to have both tandem wings oscillating, but with appropriate
> phase angle between the two, to produce both high thrust and high efficiency. Platzer et al. [15] used

> a panel code to compute the incompressible inviscid flow past oscillating finite-thickness airfoils in
> tandem arrangement. Their results again showed good agreement with Bosch’s flat-plate theory, but
> allowed the investigation of airfoil geometry effects. In a further panel code investigation, Jones and
> Platzer [16] also showed that the vortices shed from an oscillating airfoil mounted upstream of an
> elastically supported rear airfoil can have a substantial effect on the dynamic behavior of the rear
> airfoil, either exciting or suppressing flutter.
> Tuncer and Platzer [17] then analyzed the effect of viscosity using a Navier–Stokes-based code.
> Their computations revealed the fact that viscous flow effects significantly reduce the achievable
> thrust and propulsive efficiency, especially in the low-frequency range. Nevertheless, they again
> confirmed the basic physics of the Katzmayr effect, namely that an airfoil exposed to wavy upstream
> flow generates a significant amount of thrust.
> 7 APPLICATION OF KATZMAYR’S EFFECT ON FISH PROPULSION
> AND BIRD FLIGHT
> The fish is generally regarded as an efficient swimming machine. Yet, as pointed out by
> M.S. Triantafyllou and G.S. Triantafyllou [18], the fish tails have disappointingly low efficiency.
> However, a closer study shows that fish can recover energy from vortices spun off from their own
> bodies, which interact favorably with the tail. This phenomenon was first observed by Rosen [19]
> in 1959. Triantafyllou and associates [20] showed that the vortices shed from the dorsal and ventral
> finlets of the tuna fish can interact with the vortices generated by the tail in such a way that the
> body- and tail-generated vortices strengthen each other, resulting in an increased thrust, or they may
> interact in such a way as to decrease the strength of the total wake produced, thus increasing the
> propulsive efficiency. Hence, the fish is able to expose the tail to an oscillatory flow generated by the
> shedding of upstream vortices and thus to take advantage of the Katzmayr effect. Similarly, flapping
> bird wings generate an oscillatory wake, making it possible for birds flying in formation flight to
> take advantage of the Katzmayr effect.
> 8 APPLICATION OF KATZMAYR’S EFFECT FOR SHIP PROPULSION
> As early as 1936 Pavlenko [21] seems to have been the first one to recognize the benefits to
> be derived from wavy water flows for ship propulsion purposes. Valuable theoretical studies of
> the hydromechanics of swimming propulsion were carried out by Wu [22] in the 1960s using linear
> two-dimensional theory to study the oscillations of a rigid foil moving under a free surface.
> Grue et al. [23] provided additional details, again using linear theory, but adding the effect of gravity.
> They compared their results with experiments performed by Isshiki et al. [24] and found good
> agreement. Two-dimensional linearized flow investigations of this problem were also performed
> by Kulikov et al. [25], Nikolaev et al. [26] and Konstantinov and Yakimov [27]. The latter authors
> showed that ship speeds up to 7 knots could be reached due to thrust generation by the oscillating
> wing alone.
> Stefun [28] noticed already in 1959 significant ship drag reductions when he used a pair of wings
> as anti-rolling devices. He observed that the maximum drag reduction occurred when the length of
> the ship and the wavelength were approximately equal. In 1978, the first systematic ship model drag
> reduction tests were performed by the Norwegian company “Wave Control Company” in the Trondheim
> towing tank [29]. A second series of experiments were conducted by Kulikov et al. [25] in the towing
> tank of the Krylov Institute in Russia. They showed that a ship model with 16 rigidly mounted wings
> reduced the drag by 12–25% when the model executed heave-pitch and roll motions. At TSAGI in
> Moscow, Grebeshov and Shakarvene [30] investigated the thrust generated by a wing under a wavy
> free water surface, and at the Moscow State University Konstantinov and Yakimov [27] performedM.F. Platzer & E. Sorokodum, Int. J. of Design & Nature and Ecodynamics. Vol. 3, No. 2 (2008)

> water channel experiments with a ship model, which had a pair of wings mounted at the bow. They
> found that the model could move forward with a speed of 0.2 m/s in heading waves, which would
> correspond to a speed of 7 knots on a full-scale ship. Lai et al. [31] experimented with two yacht
> models, which were equipped at the stern with an elastic plate-like wing. These tests showed that the
> yacht models generated maximum thrust in heading waves when the ratio of the wavelength to the
> model length was about 1.5–2.0.
> According to Rozhdestvensky and Ryzhov [32], the first tests of full-scale ships equipped with
> underwater flapping-wings seem to have been conducted in Russia by Grebeshov and associates in
> the 1970s [30, 33–36]. The wings could be driven in a combined heave and pitch mode, making it
> possible to lift the hull out of the water and to maintain it there.
> In the 1990s, Nikolaev et al. [26] tested the 174-ton research fishing vessel shown in Fig. 6.
> The purpose of these tests was to evaluate the wave energy extraction system mounted on the
> vessel’s bow. The measurements showed that the engine power could be increased by up to 45–87%
> and reduce the ship motions by a factor of 2–2.5.
> In Japan, a 20-ton trawler was equipped with a wing at the bow [37]. The tests showed that the

> Similar tests were carried out in Norway with a 180-ton research fishing ship [38]. Two flexibly
> mounted wings were installed at the bow. At a speed of 15 knots in waves up to 3 m, almost a quarter

> 9 DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR FUTURE APPLICATIONS OF
> WAVE PROPULSION
> The preceding review of the physics and applications of the Katzmayr effect raises the question
> whether its exploitation can provide advantages in the design of future marine or air vehicles.
> As discussed in the previous section, the addition of rigidly or elastically mounted wings on ship
> hulls can lead to significant thrust increases or energy savings during operation in wavy waters
> provided the waves have suitable wave amplitudes and wave lengths. There does not seem to be an
> extensive database, which would allow the optimum design of such systems. The recent advances in
> computational fluid dynamics would certainly greatly facilitate the acquisition of a reliable database.
> Furthermore, the recent interest in the development of micro air vehicles using flapping-wing
> propulsion has stimulated the computational and experimental analysis of the “inverse” problem of
> uniform flow past flapping wings. For a summary of the current database, we refer to the papers by
> Platzer and Jones [3] and Heathcote and Gursul [4]. This information can be used, to some extent, to
> estimate the thrust and efficiency of a wing in wavy flow. Therefore, the investigation of the benefits
> to be derived from equipping ships with wings for operation in rough seas deserves further study.
> This is especially true for ships, which already use wings for stabilization purposes.
> Another exploitation of the Katzmayr effect can be realized by incorporating Schmidt’s wave
> propeller concept in the design of catamaran boats and wing-in-ground effect vehicles. Both ideas
> were already proposed by Schmidt in 1965 [10], but no work seems to have been done in realizing
> these concepts.
> Figure 8 shows Schmidt’s sketch of a catamaran boat with two wave propellers between the two
> catamaran hulls. This design appears to be still a promising configuration. Morikawa et al. [39]
> recently designed and tested a small boat, which was equipped with an outboard propulsor that

> of Schmidt propellers is likely to achieve even higher propulsive efficiencies because the vortices
> shed from the oscillating foil are converted into additional thrust by the downstream stationary foil.
> Schmidt’s wave propeller design consisted of an oscillating foil whose attitude was held constant
> while the foil moved in a circle. This design has the advantage of driving the foil at a higher
> frequency than is possible with a plunging/pitching foil. However, it has the disadvantage that the
> foil will experience flow separation problems similar to the ones encountered on helicopter blades
> during the “retreating” part of the foil motion. Jones et al. [40] showed in their design of the flapping-
> wing micro air vehicle (Fig. 9) that elastically mounted foils that undergo a combined plunge and
> pitch motion can achieve quite high thrust and efficiency levels. Also, the frequency of oscillation
> can be driven to rather high values with the crankshaft system developed for the micro air vehicle
> of Fig. 9. Furthermore, it is likely that the biplane configuration used for the micro air vehicle is
> preferable over a single oscillating foil because it provides a dynamically stable system. This was
> demonstrated quite convincingly for the micro air vehicle, which resulted in a very stable platform
> without any pitch oscillations of the complete vehicle. Addition of a stationary foil (or two foils)
> downstream of the two foils oscillating in counterphase will produce additional thrust and efficiency.
> While there is a considerable amount of design information available for the oscillating biplane
> propulsor [40], the performance characteristics of the combined biplane propulsor in combination
> with downstream stationary foils are still largely unexplored. The only viscous flow analysis of a
> single oscillating foil in combination with a downstream stationary airfoil is the one given by Tuncer
> and Platzer [17].
> Finally, we also want to draw attention to Schmidt’s proposal to use flapping-wing propulsion for
> the design and development of wing-in-ground effect vehicles. Schmidt’s proposed configuration is
> shown in Fig. 10. Here, a wave propeller is mounted downstream of a large wing used to generate
> enough aerodynamic force to lift the vehicle out of the water and to fly it above but in close proximity
> to the water. It is seen from Fig. 10 that this same concept was used in the design of the micro
> air vehicle.
> An important consideration is the speed range where flapping-foil propelled boats or wing-
> in-ground effect vehicles might have a performance advantage. The experience and the computational

> and experimental data gathered during the development of the flapping-wing propelled micro
> air vehicle provide some guidance. These studies revealed the importance of the Strouhal number
> St = f A/U where, f is the oscillation frequency, A is the amplitude of the flapping foil and U is the
> vehicle speed. Operation at low values of the Strouhal number was found to lead to low thrust and
> propulsive efficiency values due to large viscous flow losses. Since the Strouhal number decreases
> with increasing speed this fact implies an upper limit on the vehicle speeds because there are practical
> limits on the achievable foil frequencies and amplitudes. Tuncer and Platzer [17] provide some

> propelled boats and wing-in-ground effect vehicles.
> 10 CONCLUSION
> Thrust generation due to wavy flow is a well-established effect, which has been known for over
> 80 years and which has attracted considerable scientific and technical interest over the years.

> В этой работе:
> 
> - Объясняется **физика эффекта Кацмайра** — генерация тяги за счёт нестационарного (волнового) обтекания неподвижного или колеблющегося крыла.
> - Показано, что **вихревая дорожка**, образуемая при колебаниях, может индуцировать **реактивную тягу**, превосходящую традиционные методы.
> - Приводятся **эксперименты Сорокодума**, где на неподвижное крыло воздействует колеблющееся перед ним крыло — подтверждено формирование тяги при числе Струхаля 0.7–2.0.
> - Рассмотрены **примеры применения**:
>  - В авиации (летающие зонтики, дроны, дирижабли),
>  - В судостроении (корабли с антикренающими и тяговыми крыльями),
>  - В био-вдохновленных устройствах (анализ движения рыб, птиц),
>  - В микровоздушных аппаратах (MAV).
> 
> Это ключевое академическое подтверждение работ Сорокодума, связывающее его теорию с западными исследованиями.
