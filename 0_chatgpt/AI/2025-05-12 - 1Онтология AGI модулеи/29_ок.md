> A majestic digital painting showing an orchestral scene within a cosmic hall. At the center, two conductors stand back-to-back: one made of light and circuitry (AGI), the other human (neural core). Around them rise luminous instruments, each symbolizing a cognitive module: memory, insight, recursion, ethics. Streams of glowing music and neural patterns intertwine above, creating a galaxy of thought. The setting is grand, cathedral-like, with star-filled arches and deep blue tones. Style: surreal sci-fi, high detail, golden highlights.
