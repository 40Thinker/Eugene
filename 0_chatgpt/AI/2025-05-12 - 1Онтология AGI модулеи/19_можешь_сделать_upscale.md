> A traditional oil painting diptych in classical, steampunk style, depicting AGI and ChatGPT as contrasting mechanical systems. The left panel (AGI) is filled with intricate, interconnected gears, pipes, and valves representing high-level cognitive processes like planning, vision, language, tools, and exploration. The structure is dense and complex, with golden-brown metal textures and a sense of emergent intelligence. The right panel (ChatGPT) shows a simpler machine with labeled components like code, analysis, text, conversation, and answers, connected by a more linear, modular set of pipes and gears. The entire image is highly detailed and upscaled for clarity, suitable for close inspection.
