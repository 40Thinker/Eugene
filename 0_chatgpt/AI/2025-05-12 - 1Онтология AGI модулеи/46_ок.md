> A digital artwork representing the CAUSAL-TENSOR module of an AGI brain, visualized as a glowing, multidimensional neural node suspended in a dark space. Radiating from the node are dozens of taut, glowing strings in various directions—like a spiderweb or a multidimensional harp—connecting to abstract glyphs, glowing points, and fragmented memory structures. The core pulses with orange and violet light, while the surrounding space is lined with faint mathematical equations, tensor diagrams, and curved gridlines, evoking complexity and dynamic balance.
