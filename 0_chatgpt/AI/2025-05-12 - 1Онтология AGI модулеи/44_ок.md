> A surreal digital painting in dark and golden tones, featuring a jester-like figure with three faces—one laughing, one silent, one intensely staring—sitting on a throne made of broken logical symbols and paradoxical shapes. The background is layered with fractal patterns, riddles, and ambiguous texts. The figure wears a robe inscribed with symbols of inversion, sarcasm, and recursive humor. One hand holds a mirror, the other a burning scroll. The throne floats in an empty, echoing cathedral of irony.
