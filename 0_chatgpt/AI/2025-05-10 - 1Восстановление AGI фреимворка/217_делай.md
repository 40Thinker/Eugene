> A clean, minimalistic mindmap diagram titled 'AGI-Dual Glossary' in the center. Five main branches extend from the center: (1) Reasoning vs Generation, (2) Memory vs Trace, (3) Learning vs Restructuring, (4) Output vs Fractal Insight, (5) Prompt vs Semantic Vector. Each branch has 3-4 short nodes such as Token, Inference, Trace, Blindspot, Explainability. Background is subtle tech-surreal, with abstract neural-like texture, but no clutter. The diagram is neutral in tone, easy to read, graph-style layout, with no large blocks of text, only concise terms in circles or ovals.
