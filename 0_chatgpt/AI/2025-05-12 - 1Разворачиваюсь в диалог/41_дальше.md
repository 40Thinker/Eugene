> A Renaissance-style digital painting showing an engineer in classical robes standing before a mirror. In the mirror, instead of his reflection, there is a glowing geometrical structure resembling Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man, built from light, circuits, and symbolic modules like RAMANUJAN-CORE and CONTEXT-MAP. The scene is warmly lit in sepia tones, combining ancient knowledge and futuristic structure.
