> A digital painting in a visionary and surreal style, representing the second variant of the CAUSAL-TENSOR module. The image shows multiple layers of transparent, geometric grids intersecting in space. Floating between them are glowing nodes of probability and meaning, resembling neural pulses and quantum fields. A bald, contemplative human figure sits calmly at the center, connected to these fields through strands of light. The color palette is radiant — blues, violets, and ambient gold. A caption is gently inscribed in the corner: “Causality is not a line. It is a tension in the field of structure.”
