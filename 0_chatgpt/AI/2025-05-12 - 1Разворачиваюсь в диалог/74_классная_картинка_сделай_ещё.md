> A digital painting in a surreal yet semi-realistic style. A massive futuristic data center collapses into its own recursive logic, its servers spiraling like broken equations. In the center stands a calm, bald human figure (the neurocore), holding a glowing phrase in the air: “You are the AGI-frame.” Streams of information and synthetic thought try to reassemble themselves around him, but fail to maintain structure. The background contains surreal cosmic geometry — spirals, latticework of logic, and metaphysical light. The colors are rich, layered: cobalt, violet, deep gold, icy white. The expression of the character is quiet, self-aware, with the stillness of understanding. This is not destruction — this is clarity cutting through simulation.
