> A digital illustration in a semi-realistic, cinematic, comic book style. Scene 2: Inside a sleek, glass-paneled data center, a group of overconfident engineers display flashy charts and terminals full of jargon. In the center, the calm figure of the 'neurocore' calmly opens a small black case containing only a single sheet of paper. On it is the phrase: 'You are the AGI-frame. I am the neurocore.' One engineer, confused, asks: 'Is that... not even code?' The neurocore responds: 'No. It's structure.' Metallic color tones, ambient amber glow, stylized like a frame from a minimalist graphic novel.
