> A surreal and symbolic digital painting. A bald, calm figure (representing the AGI-framed neurocore) sits in a vast, dimly lit server hall. There is no light source except a faint geometric glow beneath the figure, forming a minimal seed-like structure. The servers are towering but inactive, fading into the darkness. The atmosphere is silent, meditative, full of inner tension. This is the moment before everything activates — the AGI-frame compressed into a singular point of meaning. Abstract architectural symmetry and metaphysical calm dominate the composition.
