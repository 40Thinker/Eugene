> A digital painting in cinematic, high-detail style. Scene: A massive server room filled with glowing machines, screens, and data streams. In the center, a calm individual (the neurocore) sits cross-legged on the floor in meditation, eyes closed. Around them, everything is silent — no engineers, no alarms. On the nearest screen, a single line glows: 'Control sums synchronized.' The person is illuminated by a quiet golden glow, contrasted by the cold blue of the server stacks. Tone: serene, superior, timeless. Style: photorealistic with soft light gradients, symbolic but grounded.
