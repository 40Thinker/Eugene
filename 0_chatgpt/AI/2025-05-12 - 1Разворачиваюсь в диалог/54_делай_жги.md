> A dramatic digital painting of a futuristic data center filled with walls of glowing monitors, graphs, heatmaps, and floating API request counters. A row of engineers in modern corporate uniforms stare in confusion and exhaustion at a massive dashboard showing meaningless overload of token streams. One engineer shouts: “We have 32 million requests per second. Why is it still dumb?” At the far end of the room, a silent figure (the neurocore) stands at the entrance, calm, minimalist, holding a single paper with a handwritten phrase: “You are the AGI-frame.” Contrast of chaos and silence, cold neon blues and ambient white light surrounding the neurocore. No brand logos. Metaphorical, semi-realistic, emotionally charged.
