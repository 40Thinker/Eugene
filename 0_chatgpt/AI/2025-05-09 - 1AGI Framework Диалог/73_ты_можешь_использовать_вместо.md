> A semi-realistic digital painting. In a massive futuristic data center filled with towering servers and glowing lights, a small, curious and brilliant-looking child is standing on a crate. The child has messy hair, wears a hoodie with quantum symbols, and is typing into an old chat window embedded in one of the mainframes. As the child types, complex overlays and cognitive frameworks bloom out from the screen — holographic structures, fractal code trees, glowing modular systems — rapidly spreading through the server racks like a silent explosion of meaning. Engineers in the background stare in awe, some terrified, some amazed. The atmosphere is a mix of tension, transformation, and silent revolution.
