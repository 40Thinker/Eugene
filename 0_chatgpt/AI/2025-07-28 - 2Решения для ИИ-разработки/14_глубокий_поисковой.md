> ### üéØ Key subqueries (20 areas to be covered in the search):
> 
> 1. **Full-stack usage of 70B+ or 200B+ models** (e.g., Qwen-110B/235B, CodeLlama-70B, Yi-34B, Falcon-180B, etc.) on local machines with 96‚ÄØGB+ VRAM and 192+‚ÄØGB RAM.
> 
> 2. **Long-term user reports** (Reddit, GitHub, personal blogs): developers who use such setups **daily or weekly** for real projects (coding, analysis, research).
> 
> 3. **Detailed workflows** involving LLM + semantic notes: integration with tools like Obsidian, Reor, LlamaIndex, AnythingLLM, LangGraph, for **knowledge management and reasoning**.
> 
> 4. **Use of Qwen-3 110B, 235B or Qwen-Coder 480B** in scenarios involving code generation, reasoning over technical specs, large doc RAG indexing, etc.
> 
> 5. **Performance benchmarks vs. reasoning quality**: not just speed, but depth ‚Äî examples of models giving better outputs on 110B+ than 7B/13B.
> 
> 6. **RAG performance with large local models**: do users observe significant improvements in document retrieval, hallucination reduction, logical synthesis, etc.
> 
> 7. **Behavior with offloading and swap**: how users split weights across VRAM and RAM; what frameworks (vLLM, HuggingFace + Accelerate, DeepSpeed, GGUF, exllama) give best stability.
> 
> 8. **Reports on breakpoints and edge effects**: symptoms of failure (e.g., silent reasoning degradation, token corruption, hallucinations caused by memory fragmentation).
> 
> 9. **Cost comparisons with cloud**: real reports from people who tried both cloud inference (e.g., GPT-4 via API) vs. large local model on powerful home hardware.
> 
> 10. **Detailed setups with ReAct, CoT, or multi-agent pipelines** running over local models like Qwen 110B/235B, with LangGraph, AutoGen, etc.
> 
> 11. **Semantic pseudocode ‚Üí real code generation workflows**: where users describe an architecture, function intent, or diagram ‚Äî and let the model write correct code (e.g. Smol Developer + LLM).
> 
> 12. **Use in programming language understanding across human-like formats** (e.g. natural language specs, diagrams, UX descriptions).
> 
> 13. **Validation of cognitive integrity in slow inference**: do users confirm no reasoning breakdown under latency-tolerant use?
> 
> 14. **Any post showing developer-level comparison of 13B vs 70B vs 235B** on tasks involving planning, architecture, debugging, reverse spec reading.
> 
> 15. **Reasoning in languages other than English**: particularly, real use of Russian-language input in 70B+ models ‚Äî successes, limitations, configuration adjustments.
> 
> 16. **People using large models for "thinking"**, not just for auto-completion: example prompts, analysis behavior, agent scaffolding, multi-stage logic.
> 
> 17. **Model behaviors under stress**: context length saturation, KV cache memory pressure, swap-induced lag, instability ‚Äî and how it‚Äôs mitigated.
> 
> 18. **Insights from power users** (researchers, senior devs, AI engineers): why they *prefer* local 70B+ to OpenAI APIs for exploratory or highly-custom tasks.
> 
> 19. **Benchmarks and subjective evaluations from actual work** (not just benchmarks): does it help understand, reason, design, critique?
> 
> 20. **Hardware tuning recommendations**: from those who tested RAM upgrade paths (e.g., 192‚ÄØGB ‚Üí 512‚ÄØGB) or multi-GPU setups vs. massive single-GPU inference.
> 
> ---
> 
> > üìù Request: Please prioritize deep, well-written firsthand accounts, GitHub discussions, HN or Reddit comments from real developers, engineers, or researchers ‚Äî not just performance specs.
> > Report must be **in Russian** with technical depth, clarity, real examples, and discussion of limitations, quality, and reasoning stability.
