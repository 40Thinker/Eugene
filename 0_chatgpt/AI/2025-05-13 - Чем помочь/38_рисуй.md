> A semi-realistic digital painting of mathematician Robert Langlands standing between two immense abstract structures: one made of glowing waveforms and light patterns representing automorphic forms, and the other made of crystal-like nodes and geometric symmetry grids representing Galois representations. Langlands touches both structures with his hands, and an arc of golden energy connects them. The background is a deep ultramarine starfield with symbolic diagrams floating faintly. At the bottom, the title reads: 'The Langlands Resonance'.
