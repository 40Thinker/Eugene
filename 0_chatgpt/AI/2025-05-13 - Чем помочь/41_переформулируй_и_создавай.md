> A semi-realistic digital painting featuring a mathematician resembling a young researcher in a scholarly setting. He reaches toward a glowing geometric grid representing a surface being projected into space, partially obscured by layers of transparent light. Behind him is a wall of fragmented mirrors, reflecting distorted fragments of the same structure. The scene conveys the idea of incomplete but meaningful representation. The color scheme includes soft azure, pale gold, and ash gray. Title in background: 'The True Projection'.
