> A digital painting of a young André Weil standing in front of a translucent glass panel on which a mathematical curve is drawn in white chalk. His thoughtful face is partially lit, with waves and abstract resonant patterns faintly reflected in the glass. Behind the glass, scattered points subtly arrange into geometric patterns, evoking invisible symmetry. The color scheme is muted indigo, with golden highlights illuminating parts of the curve and chalk marks.
