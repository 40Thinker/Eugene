> A semi-realistic digital painting depicting Yuri Manin and David Mumford in a softly lit mathematical chamber. Manin, in a dark coat, draws a glowing torison point symbol on a translucent board, while Mumford, in a gray jacket, watches from the side as golden points flicker and disappear inside a circular maze-like structure symbolizing an abelian variety. The environment blends deep purples and radiant gold, creating an ethereal atmosphere. The title 'The Manin–Mumford Exception' glows faintly in the background.
