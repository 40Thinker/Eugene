> A symbolic digital painting illustrating the Erdős–Ulam conjecture. A flat geometric plane stretches into the distance, with neatly arranged points in the foreground, connected by lines labeled with rational distances (fractions). As the points recede, the order breaks down into scattered chaos. In the foreground, Paul Erdős and Stanislaw Ulam are drawing a circle with a compass, but the circle fades before completion. The background fades into abstract noise, representing the breakdown of rational structure. The scene is lit in high contrast black, white, and gray tones, with a quiet, mathematical atmosphere. Caption in the image: 'Reason Cannot Tile Infinity'.
