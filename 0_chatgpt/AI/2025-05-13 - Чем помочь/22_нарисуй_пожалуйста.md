> A moody digital painting showing two mathematicians sitting at a desk, focused on a glowing graph map with interconnected nodes and edges. They are studying how to route disjoint paths across the network, but the paths begin to twist and cross, forming a tangled web of light. The central convergence point emits sparks. The background fades from deep blue to dark graphite. The mathematicians' faces show intense focus and quiet worry. In the corner, faintly written: 'k-path disjointness'.
