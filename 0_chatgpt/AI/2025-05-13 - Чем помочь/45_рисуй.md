> A digital painting titled 'The Transcendent Barrier', showing mathematician Kurt Mahler standing near the top of a staircase made of algebraic formulas that vanishes into darkness. He gazes upward at a glowing logarithmic symbol floating just out of reach. The background is a blend of deep green and midnight blue tones, with golden light softly illuminating the symbol. Equations swirl around the scene, but none connect to the radiant log symbol. The atmosphere is contemplative and mysterious.
