> In a dimly lit mathematician's study, a serious-looking man with a high forehead and dark eyebrows (Atle Selberg-like in appearance) sits in front of a chalkboard filled with plots of pi(x) and li(x), the curves slightly diverging. The air around the graph seems to shimmer subtly, as if vibrating. The man gazes thoughtfully at the chalk lines, with scattered primes glowing faintly on the table like droplets of golden rain. The color scheme is deep indigo with warm golden highlights, evoking the mysterious rhythm of prime numbers. The words 'Shanks–Rényi fluctuation hypothesis' appear softly in the shadows.
