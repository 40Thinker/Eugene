> A semi-realistic digital painting depicting two glowing prime numbers as stars connected by a thin luminous thread in deep space. In the foreground, Yitang Zhang observes them through a stylized mathematical lens, holding a notebook. The cosmos stretches behind him with vast distances between stars, but the two primes remain close. Color palette includes black, silver, and luminous blue. The image is titled 'Bounded in the Infinite' at the bottom.
