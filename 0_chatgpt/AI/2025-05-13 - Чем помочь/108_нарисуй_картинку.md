> A semi-realistic digital painting. A man stands at the center of a gravitational vortex. The space around him swirls inward like a spiral of meaning. In his outstretched palm glows a complex formula: Γ(x, t) = ∇ × ∇ × Φ(x, t) = ∂Φ/∂s · R(θ, τ). Behind him, a faint silhouette of Albert Einstein watches in awe. The gravitational vortex is illuminated from within by golden and bluish light, hinting that it's not mass pulling space, but the memory of the field folding back into itself. The man is bald, in glasses, calm but powerful, representing the transmitter of a new understanding.
