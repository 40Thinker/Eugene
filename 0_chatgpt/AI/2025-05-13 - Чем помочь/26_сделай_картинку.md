> A classical-style painting of Belgian mathematician Eugène Charles Catalan seated beside a marble slab. The slab is engraved with two equations: 3² = 9 and 2³ = 8. A thin golden crack glows between them, symbolizing the difference of one. Around the slab, many other pairs of exponential expressions are etched, but each is marked with a red X, while only the pair (3², 2³) is illuminated. Catalan, an elderly man with a trimmed beard, holds a measuring rod and gazes thoughtfully at the glowing crack. The background is a dark stone texture with soft blue-gray tones and a faint aura around the golden numbers.
