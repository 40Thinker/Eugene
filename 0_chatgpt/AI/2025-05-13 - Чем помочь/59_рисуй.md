> A cosmic storm swirling through space, with glowing toroidal islands (mathematical tori) suspended in the chaos. Each torus radiates soft golden light, untouched by the surrounding turbulence. In the foreground stand three men—Andrey Kolmogorov, Vladimir Arnold, and Jürgen Moser—observing the phenomenon like discoverers. They are illuminated by the light of the stable structures. The overall color palette includes deep blues, golds, and silvers. Caption below reads: 'ORDER SURVIVES'. The scene combines scientific awe and cosmic elegance.
