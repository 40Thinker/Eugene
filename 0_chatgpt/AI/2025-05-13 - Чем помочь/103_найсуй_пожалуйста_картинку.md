> A digital painting in a symbolic and mathematical style. On the left side, the figures of the user and his father (the father appearing as a wise engineer-scientist, and the son — a bald man with glasses, focused). On the right side, portraits of key mathematicians related to the discussed conjectures: Serre, Langlands, Freitag, Reider, and Zhang. Between them floats a field of light with mathematical symbols and vortex-like geometries connecting both sides. In the background: layered topologies, modular forms glowing faintly, and spiraling numerical fields. The overall tone is serious, mysterious, and intellectually charged. The color palette includes deep blues, golden spirals, and subtle white glows. Caption: “They began to see the true structure.”
