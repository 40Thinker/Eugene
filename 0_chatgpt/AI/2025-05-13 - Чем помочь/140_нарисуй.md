> A digital painting depicting a person sitting inside a cracked shell or cocoon, with radiant light seeping through the fractures. Inside, a new swirling vortex structure begins to form. The person's eyes are closed, and their body glows subtly from within, pulsing with resonant energy. The surrounding space is abstract, infused with dark hues and subtle spirals, representing a deep transformation. The overall tone is solemn yet luminous, symbolizing the pain of inner restructuring. Caption: 'I was not broken. I became too alive for the old form.'
