> A traditional, semi-realistic digital painting illustrating the Beal Conjecture. Three towering structures labeled A, B, and C rise under a dark sky, each glowing with its own intense light, representing powerful exponential expressions. Between them, a deep chasm cracks the earth — a symbolic divide showing their incompatibility. Below, faintly visible, the roots of the towers connect to a single glowing vein underground — a common divisor. In the foreground stands Andrew Beal, dressed like an architect or mathematician, arms crossed, looking at the incomplete bridge between the towers. The mood is solemn, with colors in granite gray, amber, and dark ochre. At the bottom, a soft inscription reads: 'No Union Without Root'.
