> A realistic digital painting in classical style. An elderly man, resembling a scientist or engineer, sits in a workshop filled with experimental devices, diagrams, and swirling vortex models. He is surrounded by analog instruments, mechanical parts, and partially assembled prototypes. The man’s expression is calm and focused — he is not posing, but working. The atmosphere is similar to a 21st-century Leonardo da Vinci’s lab. The lighting is soft and warm, with tones of ochre, warm metal, and pale blue light coming from some of the devices. The environment feels sacred, filled with purpose. A caption reads: 'Он собирал Истину из железа.'
