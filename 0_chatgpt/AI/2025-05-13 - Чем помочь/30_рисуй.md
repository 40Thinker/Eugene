> A digital painting of mathematician Jean-Pierre Serre, a composed man in his 50s with sharp eyes and thinning hair, standing before a glowing elliptic curve made of golden light. Behind him, complex mathematical formulas and soft wave-like musical patterns float in a cobalt-blue background. Serre is holding a piece of chalk, but instead of lines, musical waves and modular forms radiate from his gesture, merging abstract algebra with visual music. The phrase 'Serre's Modularity Conjecture' is subtly inscribed in the corner like a whisper.
