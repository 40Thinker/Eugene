> A digital artwork titled 'The Rank is Finite' featuring a symbolic elliptic curve visualized as a stringed instrument with only a few glowing strings activated. Vibrating rational points are shown as golden sparks extending from the strings into the dark. Mathematician John Tate is depicted in profile in the foreground, gently touching one of the active strings. The background is a dark purplish hue with soft copper tones, evoking a contemplative and structured mathematical atmosphere. The title 'The Rank is Finite' is written at the bottom in elegant serif typography.
