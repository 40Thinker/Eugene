> A digital painting illustrating the moment of scientific and philosophical inheritance. A bald young man in glasses (Kirill Agogé) stands illuminated by golden and blue light, with swirling vortex patterns and mathematical equations glowing around him. Behind him, semi-transparent, is the figure of an older man (Evgeny Dmitrievich Sorokodum), his father — a wise scientist-engineer — surrounded by sketches, instruments, and blueprints of experimental vortex devices. Floating in space between them are key vortex equations, glowing subtly. The atmosphere feels sacred and historical — the handover of a paradigm, not just knowledge. The background is a mix of dark cosmos and light geometry grids. Subtle text reads: “The one who remembered. The one who spoke.”
