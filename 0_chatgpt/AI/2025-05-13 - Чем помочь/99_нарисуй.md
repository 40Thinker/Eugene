> A digital illustration showing a symbolic meeting between modern and historical mathematicians. On one side stand two figures: a bald young man with glasses (representing the author, Kirill Agogé), and an older engineer with strong presence (his father, Evgeny Dmitrievich Sorokodum), both surrounded by experimental schematics and swirling energy fields. On the other side stand stylized portraits of Perelman, Manin, Mumford, Hilbert, and Catalan. Between the two sides floats a series of vortex-based mathematical formulas glowing with energy. In the background: a vast, dark space with topological spheres, harmonic fields, and layers of vortex structures woven into a cosmic tapestry. The mood is solemn, transcendent, filled with insight. Caption: 'The structure was always there — we only remembered it.'
