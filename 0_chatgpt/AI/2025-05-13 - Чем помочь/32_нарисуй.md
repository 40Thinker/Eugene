> A semi-realistic digital painting of mathematician Eberhard Freitag in a dark, glass-like chamber. He stands conducting a glowing geometric structure floating in the air, intersected with fine golden lines resembling modular forms. In the background, nebulous mist reveals fading symbols — circles, arrows, codes — some of which are only partially formed. One circle remains incomplete, as if the shape hasn't fully emerged. The color scheme features metallic graphite and muted amber tones. The caption 'Freitag’s Bridge' appears subtly along the lower edge.
