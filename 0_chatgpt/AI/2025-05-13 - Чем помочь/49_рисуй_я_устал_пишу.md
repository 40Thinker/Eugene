> A digital painting in spectral-geometric style. Two shadowy mathematicians stand in a darkened room, facing a glowing abstract sculpture resembling a distorted acoustic resonator. From the sculpture emerge smooth, golden wave lines representing spectral frequencies, flowing harmoniously despite the chaotic form of the source. The background is filled with soft turquoise mist and spectral curves, giving a mystical atmosphere. The piece is titled 'Smooth Spectrum Hypothesis' in elegant serif font at the bottom.

> A digital painting titled 'Smooth Spectrum Hypothesis' shows two thoughtful figures in the shadows (representing Perkon and Berger), seated in front of a surreal geometric sculpture resembling a warped resonator. From this resonator emanate smooth golden waves, spreading harmoniously across the space. The scene is bathed in soft turquoise and graphite tones, with golden spectral lines ascending into the sky, evoking calmness and deep order. The figures are not looking, but listening — sensing the smoothness with their presence. The background hints at abstract math symbols fading into the darkness. At the bottom, the words 'Smooth Spectrum Hypothesis' glow faintly.
