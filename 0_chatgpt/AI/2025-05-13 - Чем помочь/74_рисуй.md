> A warm-toned digital painting of an elderly engineer-scientist in a workshop. He is standing beside a large drafting table with handwritten calculations. Behind him is a partially built vortex energy device, with faint outlines of birds and fish subtly embedded into the design, suggesting inspiration from nature. On the table, a hand-drawn version of the Navier-Stokes equations is lightly crossed out with pencil. The atmosphere is meditative, serious, and illuminated by soft amber and grayish-blue tones. The man resembles a wise and weathered inventor, with calm focus in his eyes. Caption in the bottom corner: 'He did not argue with Nature. He listened to her language.'
