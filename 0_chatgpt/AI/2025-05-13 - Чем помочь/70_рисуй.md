> A digital painting of a young boy, around 6 to 8 years old, standing quietly by a window in the twilight. Outside the window, faint stars are visible, and mathematical formulas subtly appear on the glass like reflections. In the background, a figure of an older man (the boy's father) stands in partial shadow — firm and calm, his presence filled with quiet authority. The room is dimly lit with a warm glow from the window. The boy is not afraid; his expression is thoughtful and solemn, as if something fundamental has just shifted in his world. The scene conveys a moment of awakening. Color palette: warm gold and deep twilight blue. Caption (subtle): “I want to be worthy of understanding His Design.”
