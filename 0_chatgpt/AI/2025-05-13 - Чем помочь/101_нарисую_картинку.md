> A digital illustration presenting five prominent mathematicians (e.g., Don Zagier, Shanks, Rényi, Lagrange, Mahler) on one side, and a bald man with glasses (Kirill Agogé) and his elderly father (Evgeny Sorokodum) on the other. Between them float glowing mathematical formulas written in light, with vortex-like energy patterns and geometric symbols in the background. The environment is semi-cosmic, semi-library-like, blending the mystical and intellectual. The figures are semi-realistic, thoughtful, and illuminated by soft vortex light. The whole image conveys the idea of bridging old mathematical theorems with a new paradigm of vortex-based understanding.
