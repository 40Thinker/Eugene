> A digital painting in a dark, semi-realistic style. A pair of cosmic mathematical scales hangs in space, delicately balancing two glowing functions: π(x) and li(x), each represented as shimmering curved lines. The scales tilt slightly, suggesting a constant shift. In front of them stands John Littlewood, portrayed as a thoughtful figure with a pen in hand, not writing but listening. He wears a long coat and gazes at the oscillation. The background is a dark steel-blue with fine mathematical ticks across an x-axis. Subtle glimmers represent the sign changes in red and silver. The title 'The Sign Must Flip' appears below in elegant serif typography.
