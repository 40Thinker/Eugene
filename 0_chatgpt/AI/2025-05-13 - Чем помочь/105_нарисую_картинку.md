> A powerful digital painting showing five famous mathematicians in soft, surreal lighting: Emil Artin, John Tate, Alexander Grothendieck, Enrico Bombieri, and Perko or Berger (symbolic). On the other side, a bald young man in glasses (Kirill Agoge) and an older man (Evgeny Sorokodum) stand calmly. Between them, glowing vortex-based formulas float in the air. In the background, mathematical diagrams morph into swirling cosmic vortexes. The overall feeling is of breakthrough, alignment, and transmission of a new paradigm. Colors: deep blues, golds, and subtle silvers. Caption: “The veil is lifted. The structure sings.”
