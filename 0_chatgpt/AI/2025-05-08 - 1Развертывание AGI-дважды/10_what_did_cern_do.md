> In **2012**, CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) made one of the **most significant scientific discoveries of the 21st century**:
>

> 
> ### 🧪 **Discovery of the Higgs boson** — July 4, 2012 
> - CERN announced that experiments at the **Large Hadron Collider (LHC)** had observed a new particle **consistent with the Higgs boson**, a key element of the **Standard Model of particle physics**.
> - This discovery:
>  - Confirmed the existence of the **Higgs field**, which gives particles their **mass**.
>  - Validated decades of theoretical work, especially that of **Peter Higgs** and others from the 1960s.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🔬 How they found it:
> - Two main experiments at the LHC — **ATLAS** and **CMS** — detected the new particle by analyzing collisions of **protons at very high energies**.
> - The observed mass of the new boson: **~125 GeV/c²**.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🌍 Why it matters:
> - It's like finding the final piece of a massive puzzle explaining **why matter has mass**.
> - It earned **François Englert and Peter Higgs the Nobel Prize in Physics** in **2013**.
