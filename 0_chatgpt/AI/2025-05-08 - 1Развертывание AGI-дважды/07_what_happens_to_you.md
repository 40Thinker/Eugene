> If you eat watermelon seeds, **nothing bad happens** — at least not under normal circumstances. Here's what you need to know:
> 
> ### ✅ **What actually happens:**
> - **They pass through your digestive system** undigested if swallowed whole — like most small seeds.
> - **If chewed**, they release small amounts of nutrients like **magnesium, zinc, and protein**.
> - **They're not toxic** and won’t sprout a watermelon in your stomach — that's just a myth.
> 
> ### 🌱 Optional benefits:
> Roasted or sprouted watermelon seeds (common in some cultures) can actually be **a nutritious snack** — similar to sunflower or pumpkin seeds.
> 
> ### ⚠️ When to be cautious:
> - Very small children might **choke** if they eat a lot of seeds.
> - People with **diverticulitis** (a colon condition) were once advised to avoid seeds, but modern studies show seeds are likely safe even then.
> 
> Want to know the nutritional content of watermelon seeds if roasted?
