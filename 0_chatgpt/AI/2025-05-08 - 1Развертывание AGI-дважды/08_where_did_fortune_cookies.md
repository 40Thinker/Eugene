> Fortune cookies **originated in the United States**, not China — specifically from **Japanese-American communities in California** in the early 20th century.
> 
> ### 🥠 Key facts:
> - **Early origin**: The modern fortune cookie is most likely based on a Japanese cracker called **tsujiura senbei**, which had a paper fortune tucked inside and was made with miso and sesame.
> - **Inventors**:
>  - One popular claim credits **Makoto Hagiwara**, a Japanese immigrant who worked at the **Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco** around 1914.
>  - Another credits **David Jung**, a Chinese immigrant who founded the Hong Kong Noodle Company in **Los Angeles** around 1918.
> 
> ### 🍜 How it became "Chinese":
> After WWII, fortune cookies became popularized in **Chinese-American restaurants**, especially as a dessert in the U.S. — partly because Chinese cuisine traditionally doesn’t include sweet desserts, and this filled the gap.
> 
> So despite the stereotype, **fortune cookies are an American invention** with **Japanese roots**, popularized by **Chinese restaurants**.
