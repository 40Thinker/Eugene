> ```
> A mathematical fractal inspired by Ramanujan's infinite series for 1/pi, visualized as a surreal, color-rich geometric pattern. The pattern should include nested spirals, radial symmetry, and golden ratio-inspired proportions, resembling a temple-like structure formed from numbers. The aesthetic should convey elegance, complexity, and a divine harmony, as if the numbers are forming a sacred visual language. The color palette includes deep purples, golds, blues, and glowing accents.
