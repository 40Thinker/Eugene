> # Experiments in Separating Aiming and Firing of a Gun
> 
> ## Remote and Electronic Trigger Mechanisms 
> Firearms have been modified to allow remote or electronic triggering, meaning the shot can be fired without the shooter physically pulling a standard trigger. Historically, this was often done to eliminate shooter-induced errors during testing. As early as the 1970s, inventors developed **remotely operated trigger actuators** that attach to a gun’s trigger and fire it via an external control. For example, a 1974 US patent describes a device with a piston inserted behind the trigger and connected to a pressurized gas source; when a remote operator releases a burst of gas, the piston pushes the trigger to fire the gun【36†L141-L149】【36†L167-L175】. The goal was to keep the rifle perfectly aimed (often rested on sandbags or a bench) and remove the “human error” of jerky trigger pulls during accuracy testing【36†L141-L149】. Early implementations even included pneumatic bulb gadgets (squeeze one bulb to inflate another against the trigger) and spring-loaded plunger mechanisms, though these still risked jostling the aim【36†L153-L163】. Modern equivalents use solenoids or electromechanical strikers (“электроударник”) as remote triggers. Many **benchrest shooters and forensic testers** today use electrically or hydraulically actuated triggers so no human contact can disturb the aim when a shot breaks. In Russia, for instance, arms designers have patented electric trigger systems for cannons and small arms. One such Degtyarev Plant patent added an **electro-trigger with a firing button and timing circuit** to an automatic cannon, allowing remote firing and even control of the rate of fire by cutting off the trigger circuit at set intervals【46†L73-L81】【46†L109-L118】. The primary benefit of these systems is faster, consistent trigger activation and the ability to fire the weapon from a safe or convenient distance (e.g. from a laptop or control panel). 
> 
> Modern **adaptive equipment for disabled shooters** also employs remote trigger tech. The Ransom International **Assisted Trigger (RAT) system**, developed in partnership with the US Veterans Affairs department, is one example. It’s an electronic trigger actuator that can fire rifles, airguns, or paintball markers via alternative inputs. The shooter can aim normally, but instead of using a finger on the trigger, they activate the shot with something like a **sip-and-puff switch, foot pedal, or push-button**. In one configuration, a small tube is attached – **the user fires by a puff of breath**【34†L37-L40】. In another, a large button or a pedal can be pressed by another part of the body to discharge the firearm【34†L37-L40】. These technologies allow a person with limited hand mobility to shoot by effectively **delegating the trigger-pull to an electronic system** (which can be operated by another person or by the shooter using an alternate action). They illustrate a real-world case where *someone other than the person holding and aiming the gun – whether a caregiver or a computerized device – initiates the firing*. Such remote trigger mechanisms have clear applications: increasing safety (by removing the shooter from recoil or explosion risk), enabling people with disabilities to participate in shooting sports, and improving precision by removing flinch/jerk at the trigger press.
> 
> ## Splitting the Aiming and Firing Roles 
> Several experiments and practices have explicitly separated the act of aiming from the act of firing to see if accuracy improves or to study shooter response. In **competitive marksmanship and training**, it’s well known that a poor trigger squeeze can throw off an otherwise perfect aim. To isolate this, some instructors have tried a simple experiment: **one person aims the rifle while another person pulls the trigger**. Seasoned coaches report this as a useful drill – the shooter focuses on holding the sights on target, and a coach or partner standing by activates the trigger at the opportune moment. This way, if the shooter *is* unconsciously flinching or “jerking” in anticipation of recoil, it won’t affect the shot because they don’t know exactly when the gun will fire. As one coach described, *“Aim the rifle and have someone else pull the trigger… I do this with junior shooters to help determine if they are flinching.”*【12†L145-L153】. The results can be telling: if the shooter’s groups tighten significantly when they aren’t the one pulling the trigger, it reveals that trigger control (and anticipation) was the culprit in their misses. Such **buddy-assisted firing** is anecdotal but has been noted in shooting communities as a way to diagnose and cure a flinch.
> 
> Outside of sports, the concept of one person aiming and another firing has existed in various forms. In **crew-served weapons** (like artillery or tank guns), historically a gunner might lay the weapon on target while another crew member (on the commander’s order) pulls the lanyard or hits the fire button. This ensures the weapon fires at the precise moment of command. The separation is mainly for coordination and safety, but it shows that the roles of aimer and firer can be distinct people. Similarly, in some military sniper/spotter teams, while typically the sniper both aims and fires, there have been trials of devices that allow a spotter to electronically trigger the sniper’s rifle. The idea is that a spotter, observing conditions and target movement, might choose the best moment to fire while the sniper concentrates on holding aim. However, public documentation of such sniper-team devices is scarce – most available references revolve around the *concept* rather than a deployed system.
> 
> Scientifically, separating aim and trigger phases has been of interest to **neuroscientists and sports researchers**. They examine how stress and physiology affect the trigger squeeze. Research on Olympic and elite shooters often segments the shooting process into an *aiming/holding phase* and a *trigger-execution phase*. For instance, Finnish sports scientists Helin et al. (1987) found that elite shooters time their trigger pull to their heartbeat cycle (firing in between heartbeats during diastole)【37†L59-L68】. This implies top shooters subconsciously coordinate the two phases very tightly. In contrast, a less experienced shooter might aim well but flinch or mis-time the trigger. If one artificially separates the phases (e.g. someone else pulls the trigger or a device triggers at a set moment), one can study each component in isolation. While we did not find a specific published experiment where researchers had a second person trigger the shot for a shooter, the idea aligns with known training techniques and the desire to quantify how much trigger mechanics alone contribute to shot error. We **did** find modern sports science studies that break down a shooter’s movement into distinct phases and even suggest that aiming and squeezing should *not* be isolated in practice but smoothly integrated【10†L37-L43】. Nonetheless, the very emphasis on this integration underlines that if you *do* isolate them (say, via remote trigger), you can observe the difference in performance.
> 
> ## Computer-Aimed and AI-Activated Shooting Systems 
> Moving beyond two humans splitting the task, there are now systems where a **computer or AI assists in aiming and even decides when to fire**. A prominent example is the **TrackingPoint “Precision Guided Firearm” (PGF)** introduced in the USA in 2013. This rifle system uses a smart scope with a built-in ballistic computer. The shooter “tags” the target in the scope, and the computer then continually adjusts the aiming point. **The shooter holds down the trigger, but the gun **will not fire until** the aim is perfect according to the computer’s solution**【28†L265-L273】. In other words, the human initiates intent to shoot, but the *exact moment of firing is determined by the system’s electronics* for optimal accuracy. As one report described, *“Squeeze and hold the trigger, and only when your [aim] pip perfectly aligns with the reticle will the system’s electronic trigger reset, firing the gun.”*【26†L1-L9】 This closed-loop method removes the human’s timing error – the shooter no longer has to time the trigger press precisely, since the rifle itself chooses the instant to release the shot when the aim is correct. TrackingPoint rifles demonstrated that even novice shooters could hit targets at long range within minutes of use, by effectively **splitting the traditional shooting role**: the human does the gross aiming and target selection, but the “smart” gun handles the fine corrections and trigger break. The company emphasized that the shooter is “still in the loop” (the person must keep the trigger pressed and can cancel anytime), but essentially it’s a partnership – **human aims, computer fires**【26†L13-L16】【26†L7-L9】. This concept has clear applications in both sport (maximizing accuracy for hunters or competitors) and combat (increasing first-shot hit probability under stress). It also spawned debate about ethics and skill: knowing the rifle will fire at the *right* moment can reduce stress for the shooter【26†L7-L10】, but it also offloads a critical part of marksmanship to a machine.
> 
> Similar **“auto-trigger” smart sights** have since been developed. In Israel, the *Smart Shooter* system (tested on rifles to counter drones) can lock onto a moving target and coordinate the shot timing. A recent demonstration showed a **fire-control optic that will only let the weapon shoot when the sights are on the target**, essentially a smaller-scale version of the TrackingPoint principle. These systems blur the line between who is “firing” – the human still aims and indicates intent, but the computer ensures the trigger is pulled at the optimal millisecond.
> 
> Meanwhile, **autonomous and remote-controlled weapon platforms** take the idea further. A dramatic real-world example was reported in 2020: the assassination of an Iranian nuclear scientist was allegedly carried out by an *AI-assisted remote gun turret*. According to news reports, a **machine gun in a fixed mount was aimed via cameras and fired remotely**, with some claims that artificial intelligence aided in target recognition【44†L127-L135】【44†L162-L170】. While details remain murky, Israeli defense firms have indeed showcased man-portable or vehicle-mounted **remote turrets** that can automatically track a target and allow an operator to fire from a safe distance【44†L127-L135】. In these setups, no person is at the gun – the *“shooter”* is essentially a computer vision system plus a remote human overseer. The human (situated perhaps miles away) might designate the target and give the fire authorization, but a robotic system actually aligns the weapon and pulls the electronic trigger. South Korea’s **SGR-A1 sentry gun** and similar autonomous guard turret projects also fit this pattern: they use AI to detect intruders and can fire a gun automatically (though usually a human confirmation is required in practice). The motivation here is usually force protection – e.g. a perimeter defense gun that aims and shoots without exposing a friendly soldier to return fire. These are **technical implementations where the firing is done by a system**, based on either pre-programmed logic or remote joystick control, rather than by the person who would traditionally be looking down the sights. The proliferation of such systems in the US, Europe, China, and elsewhere is well documented in defense research; they integrate advanced sensors, gyrostabilizers, and remote trigger actuators to achieve accurate fire from unstable platforms like moving vehicles【17†L61-L69】【17†L73-L79】. 
> 
> It’s worth noting that **many modern heavy weapons already rely on remote firing** for practical reasons. Fighter jets and combat vehicles, for instance, use electronic firing for their guns: the pilot or operator aims via a screen or sight and presses an electric trigger button, which sends an electronic signal to fire the gun (there’s no direct mechanical ). This is commonplace in **remote weapon stations** on military vehicles – these are turrets mounted on tanks or armored cars that are aimed with a video feed and fired electrically from inside the vehicle. The research in China and Europe on remote weapon stations (ROWS) highlights improved stabilization, auto-target tracking, and high-precision servo control【43†L3-L9】【43†L21-L24】. In all these cases, the person aiming is not physically handling the gun barrel, and the shot is activated via a computer interface. While not a scenario of “two different people” in the loop, it is a case of **a human-machine team** splitting tasks: the human designates and roughly aims, the machine refines aim and executes the trigger.
> 
> ## Brain-Computer Interfaces and Novel Firing Controls 
> Perhaps the most futuristic way to separate the shooter from the trigger is through **brain-computer interfaces (BCI)** or other neural/emotive controls. Researchers have explored whether a shooter’s brain signals or physiological state could directly trigger a shot, bypassing the need for a finger press altogether. While we did not find evidence of a real firearm being fired by a BCI in a formal study, there are suggestive developments. For example, a Russian research team at NNSU (Nizhni Novgorod State University) announced in 2024 that they are developing a neurointerface to **speed up real-time reactions** – the context included applications in sports shooting and even archery【13†L21-L25】. The implication is a system that could read a shooter’s intent or optimal mental focus and then activate the shot faster than manual reflexes. One can imagine a sniper rifle to an EEG headset that fires at the exact moment the shooter’s brain signals peak concentration or when involuntary tremors are at a minimum. This remains largely conceptual, but it builds on known science: elite shooters demonstrate specific EEG patterns (e.g. bursts of alpha waves) just before a successful shot, reflecting a state of calm focus【18†L1-L9】【18†L25-L29】. A BCI could, in theory, monitor for that pattern and trigger the firearm at the ideal moment, removing the need for the shooter to consciously pull the trigger at all.
> 
> In the realm of **BCI gaming and simulation**, we already see analogs of this idea. A VR archery game called *MyndPlay Sports Archery* lets players shoot arrows using brain signals. The player wears an EEG headband and simply *concentrates* on the target – when focus reaches a threshold, the game “releases” the arrow. The stronger your concentration, the closer to the bullseye the arrow lands【42†L231-L238】. In one stage of this game, the player even has to enter a meditative state to make the shot, demonstrating how mental state alone can trigger an action【42†L231-L238】. This is a clear example of separating the aiming (done by the player’s avatar) from the firing (triggered by the player’s brainwaves rather than a finger press). Though just a game, it highlights possible real-world use: a **shooter could someday fire by simply deciding to, with a neural interface detecting that decision**. The US Army has indeed funded research on “neural bypass” systems for pilots and soldiers – for instance, detecting the intention to shoot or the onset of a threat response in the brain to speed up weapon firing, although concrete results remain confidential or experimental.
> 
> Apart from EEG, other biosignals have been tested. For instance, **EMG muscle signals** or eye-tracking could trigger a shot – imagine clenching your jaw or b to fire. There are patents for **voice-activated triggers** and other novel inputs, but those are rarely implemented due to reliability and safety concerns (you don’t want a gun firing on an accidental cue). One safer avenue has been using such methods for **training without live ammo**: e.g. devices that detect the shooter’s brain or heart signals at the moment they *would have* fired and give feedback, without needing to pull a trigger. This helps train timing and stress management.
> 
> Finally, it’s important to mention the **ethical and practical limitations** of these approaches. Having someone else or an AI fire the weapon raises questions of accountability and control. In sports like biathlon or target shooting, rules would forbid a second person from influencing the shot – the athlete must both aim and shoot. So while a coach could experiment with remote triggering in practice, the shooter ultimately has to master doing both simultaneously. In combat, giving an AI full control to aim and fire can be risky, which is why most armed robots still keep a “human in the loop” for the final trigger pull. Brain-computer interfaces are still limited by signal noise and reaction time – an EEG-triggered gun might fire a few tenths of a second after the brain decides, which might or might not be faster than a trained finger.
> 
> ## Conclusion and Possible Applications 
> In summary, **there have been numerous implementations and studies of firing a gun without the shooter pulling the trigger directly**. These range from mechanical gadgets and electronic firing pins for remote trigger pull, to scenarios where one person aims and another person (or a computer) decides when to fire. We’ve seen real examples in **Russia, the US, Europe, and China**: from Soviet-era electric triggers in aircraft cannons【46†L73-L81】, to American smart rifles that **“fire themselves”** when on target【28†L265-L273】, to Israeli remote turrets that can be operated over a wireless link【44†L127-L135】. The driving motivations include: **improving accuracy** (by removing human trigger error or timing shots perfectly), **enhancing safety** (keeping the shooter or soldiers away from return fire or recoil), **enabling new users** (allowing disabled shooters or even brain-controlled operation), and sometimes **gaining tactical advantage** (faster reaction or autonomous engagement).
> 
> Possible directions for application of these concepts are exciting and varied. In sports shooting, coaches could use dual-person setups or remote-trigger devices to train athletes to hold steady and overcome flinch – essentially using technology as a stepping stone to better technique. There is also talk of using sensor fusion (heart rate, stability sensors, etc.) to create a “smart trigger” that won’t fire if the muzzle is wavering or the shooter’s physiology is off – this could assist under pressure or fatigue. In military and law enforcement, remotely-operated guns are already used (for example, robot sentries or bomb-disposal robots with shotguns). As AI improves, one can imagine a sniper rifle that suggests or even executes the perfect shot the instant a target is in the crosshairs, with the sniper’s role shifting to supervision and target selection. **Neurotechnology** might someday allow a fighter pilot to fire weapons at the speed of thought, cutting down reaction lag. And for disabled individuals or those with injuries, brain or voice-controlled firearm systems (combined with advanced safety checks) could restore their ability to participate in hunting or competitive shooting, which is an active area of innovation in places like the USA.
> 
> In conclusion, the separation of aiming and trigger-pulling is not only a thought experiment – it has been *prototyped, tested, and in some cases fielded*. From simple coach-and-student trials on the range【12†L145-L153】, to patented devices for remote firing【36†L167-L175】, to sophisticated **fire control systems where a computer shares the trigger duty**【26†L1-L9】, the idea has proven valuable. Each implementation reveals something about the shooting process: that steady aim and a clean trigger break are both crucial and can be independently optimized. The challenge ahead is integrating these innovations in a way that keeps the shooter in control while leveraging the benefits of delegation – whether that “other trigger finger” is a fellow human, a robot, or one’s own neural signals.
