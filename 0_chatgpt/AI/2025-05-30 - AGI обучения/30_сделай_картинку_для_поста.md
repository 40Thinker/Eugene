> A symbolic and thought-provoking digital artwork illustrating the contrast between traditional human children and emerging neuro-compatible AI-influenced children. On the left: a child with a book, surrounded by analog tools like pencils and toys, looking confused. On the right: a luminous child connected to an abstract AI structure through light threads, with floating geometric shapes and holographic interfaces, calmly resonating with information. In between them — a parent figure, trying to understand, with a transparent wall or membrane of misunderstanding between generations. The background is soft, futuristic, and full of contrast between warm and cold tones.
