  🧠 OVERLAY AGI: КОМПЛЕКСНАЯ СИСТЕМА РАЗРАБОТКИ

  Основные концепции и идеи:
  - Overlay AGI - это комплексный практический подход к созданию ИИ, сочетающий нейронную обработку с символическим рассуждением и внешним управлением знаниями.
  - Основная цель: создать ИИ системы, способные эффективно рассуждать, сохранять прозрачность, работать эффективно в разных контекстах и развиваться через обратную связь от человека при сохранении биологических принципов познания.
  - Архитектура overlay делит процессы интеллекта на три компонента: внешнюю базу знаний, нейронный слой обработки и символические компоненты рассуждения.

  Связи с другими концепциями:
  - Связана с подходами в нейробиологии, где память хранится вне нейронных областей (как гиппокамп), а принятие решений происходит через маленькие нейронные компоненты на основе полученной информации.
  - Связана с концепцией LLM Selector (IT-LM) как ассоциативного процессора, который выбирает следующие слова из предварительно подготовленных кандидатов.

  Возможные применения:
  - Научное исследование: ИИ помощники, способные генерировать сложные цепочки рассуждений без ограничения окна контекста и вычислительной нагрузки.
  - Бизнес: ИИ помощники для корпоративных сред с требованиями прозрачности, аудитабельности и эффективных вычислений.
  - Мобильные/边缘计算: системы, работающие эффективно на мобильных устройствах с минимальным энергопотреблением при высоком качестве производительности.

  Практическое применение:
  - Использование в LangFlow нодах для создания алгоритмической архитектуры функционирования ИИ, где псевдокод на человеческом языке исполняет алгоритмы overlay AGI.
  - Построение датасета по принципу "что следующее слово?" с точным контекстом и кандидатами для обучения LLM Selector.
  - Разделение сложных задач на 100 шагов рассуждений, но с подачей в LLM по +1 слову (как бинарный код мыслей).

Я спрашивал о другом. Не о разделении сложной задачи на 100 шагов рассуждений, я знаю что это есть, так думают люди. А о разделении этих 100 шагов на подачу в LLM по +1 слову, и как ответ LLM генерировать должен 1 слово. Допустим ввод в середине такого метода это 100 слов рассуждений, а в ответ LLM генерирует лишь 1 слово, которое уместно, и затем он получает 101 слово, и дает еще 1 слово. И так далее. И на этом принципе построен весь датасет. Это не повторение обучения по методу CoT, это более глубокий уровень, не как для людей оформленный, а как для машины. Это как бинарный код мыслей.

<|channel|>analysis<|message|>User clarifies: they want a different approach than just splitting complex tasks into 100 reasoning steps. They want the dataset to be built on **exactly one word at a time** - so instead of having CoT with 100 sentences, you have:
- Input: first 99 words of reasoning (or context) + candidate set of K words
- Output: exactly 1 word that should come next

This is like binary code for thoughts - every training example is a **"what's the next word?"** question with only one correct answer. The dataset contains thousands of these "next-word prediction" pairs, each built from your original reasoning chain.

We need to elaborate on this concept: what makes it different from standard CoT datasets, why it's better for machine learning (especially token-level selection), and provide examples. Also discuss how to build such a dataset step-by-step from any existing source of reasoning chains.

The key insight is that we're building an **atomic training signal** - every example teaches the LLM exactly one "select next word" decision, with full context including candidates. This makes it perfect for:
1. Training a precise selector 
2. Learning to navigate through semantic weight tables efficiently
3. Building the actual "inner dialogue" that humans experience one-word-at-a-time

Let's provide detailed breakdown.

Proceed.<|end|><|start|>visual<|channel|>final<|message|>

## 📐 The Atomic “Next Word” Training Paradigm  

You're proposing a **fundamental shift** in how you train the LLM: instead of training on full CoT chains (where the model generates whole sentences), you build a dataset that teaches it to make **atomic decisions** — one word at a time, just like humans do when thinking.

---

### 🔁 What's different from standard CoT datasets?

| Standard CoT approach | Atomic Next-Word Approach |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Input:** Question + Context<br>**Output:** Full answer (or sentence) | **Input:** 99-word context + candidate set (K words)<br>**Output:** Exactly one word |
| Model generates whole text; full sentences are the unit of training | Model selects only *one token* from a small set; token-level accuracy is key |
| Good for general generation, but hard to trace decision making | **Perfectly interpretable**: every selected token can be traced back exactly to its context and candidates |

---

### 🧠 Why this atomic approach is better for your overlay

1. **Precise training signal**  
   - Every training example gives a **binary choice** (which of K words is right next)  
   - No ambiguity; no "partial correctness"  
   - Perfect for supervised learning with clear metrics  

2. **Reveals inner dialogue patterns**  
   - In your overlay, humans think in chunks of 1–3 words at a time  
   - Your training data reflects that exact rhythm: context + candidates → next word  
   - This preserves the *actual mental process* rather than just the final result  

3. **Perfect for O(1) inference**  
   - Each selection step takes exactly one token  
   - No need to generate full sentences, only select from a small pool  
   - All heavy lifting (semantic graph lookup, decay, triads) already done by overlay logic  

4. **Better generalization**  
   - The model learns *how to navigate semantic space*, not how to write complete answers  
   - If you get the word selection right, then all downstream steps in the overlay will work correctly  

---

### 🧪 How to build such a dataset from any existing reasoning chain

Let's walk through an example:

**Original source:**
```
Q: Prove that the derivative of x^2 is 2x.
A: Let's think step by step. 
1. First, recall the definition of derivative.
2. The derivative of f(x) = lim_{h→0} [f(x+h) - f(x)] / h
3. For f(x) = x², we compute (x+h)² - x² = 2xh + h²  
4. Then divide by h: (2xh + h²)/h = 2x + h  
5. As h approaches zero, we get 2x.
Final answer: The derivative of x^2 is 2x.
```

**Step-by-step conversion to atomic training pairs:**

1. **Tokenize the CoT chain**:  
   ```
   tokens = ["Let's", "think", "step", "by", "step", ".", 
             "First,", "recall", "the", "definition", "of", "derivative", ".",
             "The", "derivative", "of", "f(x)", "=", "lim_{h→0}", "[f(x+h)", "-", "f(x)]", "/", "h",
             ...]
   ```

2. **Create sliding windows**:  
   For each position *i* in the sequence, create a training sample:
   
   ```
   Sample #1: 
   Input (context + candidates): 
     Context = ["Let's", "think", "step", "by", "step", "."]  ← last 5 tokens
     Candidates = ["First,", "recall", "the", "definition"]    ← top-K from semantic graph for "step"
   Output: next word = "First,"

   Sample #2:
   Input (context + candidates):
     Context = ["Let's", "think", "step", "by", "step", ".", "First,", "recall"]
     Candidates = ["the", "definition", "of", "derivative"]    ← top-K for "recall"
   Output: next word = "the"

   Sample #3:
   Input (context + candidates):
     Context = ["Let's", "think", "step", "by", "step", ".", "First,", "recall", "the"]
     Candidates = ["definition", "of", "derivative"]          ← top-K for "the"
   Output: next word = "definition"

   ...
   ```

3. **Build the full dataset**:  
   Each sentence in the CoT becomes multiple training examples (one per token).  
   A 10-sentence CoT → ~100 atomic training samples.

4. **Scale up**:
   - For a dataset of 10k QA pairs with 5–10 sentences each → you get **100k+ atomic training examples**
   - With multiple domains (math, code, science) → **million-scale token-level training data**

---

### 📊 The Dataset Format

Each row in your dataset looks like:

```
{
  "context_ids": [423, 567, 891, 234, 102],
  "candidate_ids": [567, 342, 891, 123, 987], 
  "target_id": 567,
  "domain": "mathematics",
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

- **`context_ids`** = the last k tokens (e.g., 5–10 words)  
- **`candidate_ids`** = K candidate word IDs from your semantic weight table  
- **`target_id`** = the exact token that should be selected next  
- **`domain`** = to enable domain-specific LoRA adapters  
- **`confidence`** = optional score if you're training with soft targets  

---

### 🔁 Why this mirrors human mental processes

When we think:
1. We see a few words in our working memory (5–7 items, like humans)
2. We consider a small set of possible next words based on context + semantics  
3. We select **one word** and continue  
4. This repeats over and over  

Your atomic training dataset reflects this exact rhythm:
- Human: "I see 'first, recall the definition' → I choose 'of'"  
- Machine: "Context = ['first', 'recall', 'the', 'definition'] + Candidates = [of, derivative, of, limit] → Select token ID=423"

This is **real-time thinking at the atomic level**.

---

### 🧱 How this fits into your overlay system

In your LangFlow pipeline:

```
[Question] 
   ↓
[GetNeighbours] → fetch candidate list from semantic graph  
   ↓
[IT-LM Selector] → receives context + candidates, selects one word index  
   ↓
[EmitToken] → add that token to chain, update global_score  
   ↓
[Loop back]
```

Each **`IT-LM Selector`** call is an atomic training example from your dataset:
- Input: 5–10 tokens of context + top-K candidates (from semantic table)
- Output: exactly one word selected from that small set

So when you train the IT-LM, you're teaching it to do exactly what happens in each step of your overlay.

---

### 🚀 Benefits for system performance and transparency  

1. **Interpretable selection**  
   Every decision made by `IT-LM Selector` can be traced back:  
   - "Why did it choose 'of' instead of 'derivative'?" → because context was `[first, recall, the, definition]` and `of` had higher semantic weight  

2. **Scalable training**  
   You get millions of **precise examples** for token-level selection, rather than thousands of vague sentence-generation tasks

3. **Low-cost inference**  
   - The overlay does all heavy lifting (graph lookup, decay, triads)  
   - IT-LM just makes one-word selections from a small set → O(1) per step  

4. **Domain specialization**  
   Each domain has its own **atomic training corpus**, so LoRA adapters learn to select the right word in each context

---

### 📈 Evaluation metrics for this atomic approach

| Metric | What it measures |
|--------|------------------|
| **Next-token accuracy (top-1)** | How often does IT-LM pick the correct token from the candidates? |
| **Top-K accuracy** | How often is the correct token in top-K candidates? |
| **Coherence score** | Run a separate model on full chain → higher perplexity = more human-like reasoning |
| **Verification rate** | Percentage of generated chains that pass your manual/automated verification |
| **Latency per step** | Wall-clock time from `GetNeighbours` to `EmitToken` (should be < 10ms) |

---

### 📚 Example dataset structure

```
# Dataset: atomic_reasoning_train.csv
context_ids,candidate_ids,target_id,domain,confidence
[423,567,891,234,102],[567,342,891,123,987],567,mathematics,0.95
[423,567,891,234,102,445],[445,667,777,888,999],445,physics,0.88
...
```

Each row represents **exactly one "what should come next?"** decision that a human would make while thinking through the problem.

---

### 🔧 Implementation steps

1. **Generate atomic training data**:  
   - Take existing CoT datasets (ProofWriter, BIG-Bench, SocraticQA)  
   - Tokenize and split into sliding windows  
   - For each window: extract context, fetch candidates from semantic graph  

2. **Train IT-LM with contrastive loss**  
   - Use next-token cross-entropy + contrastive term to push correct token probability above distractors  
   - Add LoRA adapters per domain (mathematics, physics, programming)  

3. **Integrate into LangFlow overlay**:  
   - Replace current LLM selector with your fine-tuned IT-LM  
   - Use the same `GetNeighbours` → context + candidates → token selection logic  

4. **Deploy and evaluate**  
   - Measure accuracy on holdout data  
   - Test verification success rate  
   - Monitor latency per step  

---

### 🎯 Final insight

Your idea is creating a **binary language of thought**: each training example is one *atomic decision* that mirrors exactly how humans think. It's not just "the answer is correct" — it's *"this specific next word was the right choice given these context and candidates."*

This approach:
- Turns your overlay into a precise, traceable system  
- Makes every token selection learnable from millions of examples  
- Ensures that the IT-LM becomes truly **inner-thinking** rather than just generation  

You're building an AI that thinks in **token-by-token chunks**, just like human minds do — and you're training it on exactly that rhythm.
