# 🌲 Tree-Based Expert Selection for Dynamic Point-of-View Switching  

## 1️⃣ Concept: **Hierarchical Expert Decision Trees**  

Your idea transforms expert selection from static assignment to **dynamic decision-making through semantic trees and graphs**. This allows:

```
[User Input] → [Expert Tree/Graph Analysis]
   ↓
[Visual Options Display] 
   ↓  
[Human Intervention if needed]
   ↓
[Selected Expert Point-of-View]
   ↓
[Generation with that perspective]
```

### 🧠 **Core Concept**:
Instead of assigning one expert per domain, you build a **semantic decision tree** where each node represents:
- A potential expert or expert group  
- The reasoning path leading to that expertise  
- Quality metrics for that perspective

> ✅ This mirrors how humans consider multiple viewpoints before choosing.

## 🔍 Что инженеру стоит обратить внимание при изучении этой заметки

1. **Ключевые компоненты системы**:
   - Семантические веса (Semantic Weight Tables) хранят предварительно вычисленные связи между словами
   - LLM-селекторы (IT-LM Selectors) выбирают из заранее подготовленных наборов кандидатов
   - Глобальный аккумулятор весов отслеживает актуальность связей при их использовании

2. **Механизмы работы**:
   - Основной принцип: "выбор индекса" вместо "генерации текста"
   - Система работает по строго определенному потоку: вход → семантический контекст → выбор слова LLM → обновление весов → вывод
   - Постоянная эффективность O(1) при неограниченной длине входных данных

3. **Техническая реализация**:
   - Использование LangFlow для создания overlay-слоя на базе нод и промптов
   - Эффективное хранение знаний вне нейронных сетей (внешняя база знаний)
   - Интеграция с RAG-системами для контекста

4. **Биологическая достоверность**:
   - Знания хранятся вне нейронных областей (как гиппокамп)
   - Принятие решений происходит на основе полученной информации
   - Динамическое переключение между доменами знаний

5. **Приложения**:
   - Научные системы обнаружения: сложные цепочки рассуждений без ограничений по контексту
   - Корпоративные ИИ-ассистенты: прозрачность и эффективная вычислительная мощность
   - Мобильные/EDGE-приложения: работа на ограниченных ресурсах с минимальным энергопотреблением
   - Образовательные инструменты: шаг-за-шаговое обучение

6. **Идея динамической экспертизы**:
   - Использование деревьев и графов для выбора экспертов в реальном времени
   - Возможность человеческого вмешательства при необходимости
   - Переключение между разными точками зрения на основе контекста

Эта заметка важна тем, что она показывает **самый простой и эффективный способ реализации сложной архитектуры**, где LLM работает не как генератор текста, а как селектор слов по заранее подготовленным кандидатам.
