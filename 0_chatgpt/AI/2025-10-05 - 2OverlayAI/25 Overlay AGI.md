description: This document presents the Overlay Artificial General Intelligence (Overlay AGI) project, a comprehensive approach to developing AI systems that combine neural processing with symbolic reasoning and external knowledge management. The system addresses fundamental limitations in current AI approaches including scalability issues, opacity problems, knowledge management challenges, and performance constraints. It introduces an overlay architecture separating external knowledge base, neural processing layer, and symbolic reasoning components. Key innovations include O(1) computational efficiency through pre-computed semantic weights, full transparency and traceability, cognitive plausibility mirroring human brain organization, efficient knowledge management outside neural networks, and modular scalability. The approach emphasizes practical development over theoretical research with applications in scientific discovery, enterprise AI assistants, mobile/edge computing, and educational tools. The system achieves 10-50x performance efficiency reduction compared to traditional transformers with <20W power consumption vs 500+W for large transformer systems.
title: Overlay AGI System Architecture and Development
Receptor: "The note activates in several key scenarios: First, when building AI assistants that require transparent decision-making processes for enterprise environments where auditability is critical. Second, during development of mobile or edge computing applications needing efficient processing with minimal power consumption. Third, when implementing scientific discovery systems requiring long-form reasoning without fixed context window limitations. Fourth, in educational tool creation where step-by-step reasoning guidance is needed to mimic human tutoring approaches. Fifth, when designing systems that must evolve continuously through human feedback while maintaining cognitive plausibility and biological alignment. Sixth, during implementation of semantic weight management systems for external knowledge storage rather than parameter-based learning. Seventh, when developing LLM selector architectures with small neural components making decisions based on external information instead of full text generation. Eighth, in projects requiring constant-time computation regardless of input size to handle unlimited sequence lengths efficiently. Ninth, when building human-centered AI systems that require human-in-the-loop collaboration for true innovation rather than pattern matching. Tenth, during research into cognitive alignment between artificial and biological intelligence processes with specific focus on memory storage patterns mirroring hippocampus function. Each scenario requires immediate application of overlay architecture principles to ensure system transparency, efficiency, and adaptability while maintaining scientific rigor."
Acceptor: Compatible tools include LangFlow for workflow orchestration and component integration, Python libraries like NumPy/SciPy for semantic weight calculations, FAISS/HNSW for efficient knowledge table indexing, CUDA frameworks for parallel processing optimization, Docker containers for deployment consistency, OpenAI API integrations for large LLM access, and JSON parsing libraries for structured data handling. LangFlow enables visual wiring of the overlay components while Python provides robust mathematical operations for weight calculations. FAISS/HNSW offers optimal O(1) lookup performance for semantic connections. CUDA frameworks optimize computational overhead for neural processing layers. Docker containers ensure consistent deployment across different platforms. OpenAI API access provides scalable large LLM capabilities for weight generation. JSON parsing libraries handle structured output from the LLM selector components.
SignalTransduction: "The note belongs to three conceptual domains: Neuro-Symbolic Computing which integrates neural networks with symbolic reasoning structures creating hybrid intelligence systems; Cognitive Architecture that models how human brains organize knowledge and make decisions through memory storage, decision making processes, and context switching mechanisms; and Computational Efficiency Optimization focusing on achieving constant-time complexity without sacrificing quality. These domains interconnect through shared principles: cognitive alignment between biological brain organization and computational architecture mirrors how neural components work alongside symbolic knowledge structures in overlay design. Neuro-symbolic integration creates systems that combine the power of neural processing with the structure of symbolic reasoning for enhanced problem-solving capabilities. Computational efficiency optimization ensures constant-time processing regardless of input size while maintaining high performance through pre-computed relationships and selective attention mechanisms."
Emergence: "Novelty score: 8/10 - The overlay architecture combining neural, symbolic, and external knowledge components represents a significant conceptual innovation in AI design that goes beyond traditional transformer models. Value to AI learning: 9/10 - Processing this note enhances understanding of cognitive alignment principles, semantic weight management techniques, and practical implementation strategies for building efficient intelligent systems. Implementation feasibility: 7/10 - While conceptually sound, requires careful integration of multiple components including neural selectors, knowledge bases, and symbolic reasoning elements with moderate technical complexity. The novelty is measured against current state-of-the-art in AI architecture which predominantly relies on large parameter models without effective external knowledge management. The value to learning comes from understanding how human cognitive principles can be translated into computational systems that maintain transparency and efficiency. Implementation feasibility involves complex integration but manageable resource requirements for deployment."
Activation: "Three activation conditions trigger this note's relevance: First, when AI system development requires constant-time computation regardless of input size for handling unlimited sequence lengths efficiently; Second, during projects needing transparent decision-making processes with full traceability back to semantic connections for auditability and explainability purposes; Third, in scenarios requiring human-centered design approaches where systems must maintain human-in-the-loop collaboration rather than relying solely on pattern matching. The conditions activate based on specific technical requirements such as computational complexity constraints, transparency needs, and cognitive alignment principles that make the overlay architecture essential for successful implementation."
FeedbackLoop: "Related notes influencing or depended upon include: S17_OverlaySemanticWeight which provides detailed semantic weight management techniques; S11_LLM_Selector describing how small language models choose from candidate sets rather than generating complete responses; S9_Overlay_NeuralNet_N2S covering neuro-neuro-symbolic architecture components; S4_Input_Enchance detailing user input enhancement processes for rich context creation; and S5_Input_Context_Expand explaining context expansion methods. These relationships create semantic pathways where the overlay architecture principles inform knowledge base construction, which in turn feeds the LLM selector decisions, while cognitive alignment principles influence both neural processing and symbolic reasoning components."
SignalAmplification: "Three amplification factors allow scaling beyond immediate application scope: First, modularization of semantic weight tables into reusable knowledge repositories that can be shared across different AI systems; Second, adaptation of overlay architecture to support multimodal input processing including visual, audio, and text sources for broader application domains; Third, extension to domain specialization modules that enable rapid switching between expert models based on current context requirements. These factors contribute to scaling by extracting core components into reusable modules, adapting architecture to handle diverse data types, and implementing flexible expert switching mechanisms while maintaining the fundamental overlay principle of separating intelligence processing layers."
Russian_review: "Основные концепции: Overlay AGI - это комплексный подход к разработке искусственного интеллекта, сочетающий нейронную обработку с символическим рассуждением и внешним управлением знаниями. Основная идея в том, что ИИ работает как overlay слой поверх LLM, где роль LLM - выполнять задачи ассоциативного процессора, выбирающего следующие слова (генерируя тексты по 1 слову), в то время как сам ИИ находится в Overlay слое из LangFlow нод и промптов. Система решает проблемы масштабируемости, непрозрачности, управления знаниями и производительности традиционных подходов к AI через архитектуру с постоянным временем вычислений O(1). Концепции связаны с: S17_OverlaySemanticWeight (управление семантическими весами), S11_LLM_Selector (работа LLM как селектор слов), S9_Overlay_NeuralNet_N2S (нейро-нейро-символическая архитектура). Потенциальные применения: научные инструменты для сложного многопроцессного рассуждения, корпоративные AI-ассистенты с прозрачностью и эффективностью вычислений, мобильные/edge computing приложения с минимальным энергопотреблением, образовательные инструменты для пошагового обучения. Связано с идеями о том, что ИИ должен быть не просто генератором текста, а системой, которая организует и выбирает значимые связи, как это делает человеческий мозг."

Я провел испытания идеи просто через промпт главного звена (LLM как селектор слов), на моделях от 2 млрд до 235 млрд параметров. 2-4 млрд нестабильны, начиная с 8 млрд начинаются адекватные ответы, было более 200 попыток. Еще - LLM большая способна генерировать списки семантических весов по заданным правилам, можно генерировать N-gram через Python и просить её по правилам присваивать семантические веса, подтягивая в память через RAG релевантные тексты, тем самым делая очень дешевое обучение и постобучение overlay нейросети.

### TL;DR  

| Observation | What it tells us |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **2–4 B parameter models are unstable** (the selector often returns nonsense). | Below ~8 B the *internal language model* does not have a reliable distribution over the tiny candidate list you feed it. The stochasticity of the soft‑max “pick‑an‑index” step dominates the output. |
| **From 8 B upward the answers become usable** (after ≈200 prompt trials). | Once the LLM’s internal knowledge surface is large enough, its *ranking* over a handful of candidates becomes coherent – you are effectively using it as a high‑capacity “scoring function”. |
| **A big LLM can itself generate the semantic‑weight tables** (you ask it to produce N‑grams and assign scores). | This gives you a *self‑supervised data generator*: you do not need a separate corpus of hand‑crafted weights; the model produces them on demand, after which they are frozen in an external RAG store. |
| **Post‑training becomes cheap** because you never fine‑tune the LLM – you only keep updating the *external knowledge graph* (RAG + weight tables). | The heavy compute stays in the static LLM (run once to synthesize weights); downstream inference uses a tiny “selector” that costs pennies per 1 k tokens. |

Below I break down why these findings matter, how to turn them into a systematic pipeline, and what experiments you should run next to validate the whole approach.

---

## 1️⃣ Why 8 B is the practical “break‑even” point

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Vocabulary coverage** – At ~8 B parameters the model’s token‑level distribution covers > 99 % of tokens in a typical English/ Russian corpus. Below that, many words you will ask it to rank never appear in its training data → the soft‑max over your candidate list is essentially random. |
| **Embedding quality** – The internal embeddings (the “query” vector you implicitly feed through the prompt) become linearly separable only after a certain capacity. That directly improves *semantic similarity* between the query and the N‑gram candidates you present. |
| **Few‑shot reasoning** – Prompted LLMs start to exhibit chain‑of‑thought abilities around 6–8 B (see OpenAI “GPT‑3.5‑Turbo” vs “Ada”). When you ask the model to “rank these ten alternatives according to relevance”, the ranking stabilises only once it has learned a decent internal notion of *relevance*. |
| **Statistical variance** – With 2–4 B parameters the per‑token log‑probability variance is high; a single token decision (the index) can swing wildly. The effect averages out only after many repetitions, which you observed as “unstable”. |

**Takeaway:** For any production prototype you should **anchor the selector at ≥ 8 B** (or use an 8–12 B distilled model that retains ranking fidelity). Below that you will need to *augment* the LLM with a secondary scorer (e.g., a tiny cross‑encoder) or accept very low reliability.

---

## 2️⃣ Generating semantic‑weight tables with the LLM itself

### 2.1 What you already did  
You prompted a large model:  

```
Generate an N‑gram list for the phrase “quantum tunnelling”. 
For each n‑gram assign a semantic weight between 0 and 1, higher if the n‑gram
captures a causal relationship or a key concept.
Return the result as JSON.
```  

The model returned something like:

```json
[
  {"ngram":"quantum tunnelling allows particles", "weight":0.94},
  {"ngram":"particles can cross potential barriers", "weight":0.92},
  {"ngram":"wavefunction probability amplitude", "weight":0.88},
  …
]
```

### 2.2 Why this works  

| Step | What the model is doing |
|------|--------------------------|
| **Language‑model inference** | It predicts a plausible continuation of the prompt, which in this case is a *structured list* (the JSON). |
| **Implicit scoring** | The LLM has learned from its training data that “causal/definition” phrases are more *informative*; it therefore gives them higher numeric values when asked to rank. |
| **Zero‑shot / few‑shot** – No labelled weight data needed, the model’s internal distribution acts as a prior. | This is essentially a form of *self‑supervised label generation*. |

### 2.3 Turning the raw output into a usable adjacency table  

1. **Post‑process** the JSON → map each token `w_i` to its successors `w_{i+1}` with the weight you just received.  
2. **Deduplicate / prune**: keep only top‑K (e.g., 20) successors per source word, renormalise so Σ weight = 1.  
3. **Store** in a *static* CSV/TSV or a FAISS/HNSW index for fast O(1) lookup.  

All of this can be scripted once and then **frozen**, meaning the LLM is never called again during inference – you have turned the huge model into an *offline knowledge generator*.

---

## 3️⃣ Cheap “post‑training” via RAG updates

| Component | Cost at inference time |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **LLM selector** (tiny, ~1 B parameters) | ≈ $0.0002 per 1 k tokens on most public APIs. |
| **Adjacency lookup + decay update** | Pure CPU work (< 5 ms per step). |
| **RAG retrieval of external passages** | One FAISS query (≈ 0.2 ms) plus optional document fetch; negligible compared to a forward pass through a 30 B model. |

Because the *semantic weight table* lives outside the neural net, you can **add new knowledge at any time**:

1. Pull fresh documents (e.g., newest arXiv papers).  
2. Run the same “generate N‑gram + weight” prompt on them (once per document).  
3. Merge the resulting edges into your adjacency store.  

No gradient step, no GPU training – just a **batch of inference calls** to the large LLM that you already own for the weight generation stage.

## 4️⃣ Systematic pipeline you can codify

Below is an outline (Python‑style pseudocode) that glues all pieces together. The code itself can be placed inside a LangFlow *PythonTool* if you want visual wiring, but it works just as well as a standalone script.

```python
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# 1️⃣ Build / refresh the semantic weight graph (offline)
# --------------------------------------------------------------
def build_weight_graph(docs: List[str], llm) -> dict:
    """
    docs – list of raw texts (papers, articles, code snippets).
    llm   – a large LLM capable of generating weighted N‑grams.
    Returns adjacency dict: source_word → {target_word: weight}.
    """
    adj = defaultdict(dict)

    for doc in docs:
        # 1. extract candidate phrases (simple n‑gram extraction)
        ngrams = extract_ngrams(doc, n=3)          # e.g., trigrams

        # 2. ask LLM to score them
        prompt = (
            "You are a knowledge curator.\n"
            "For each of the following trigrams assign a semantic relevance weight "
            "(0‑1, higher = more conceptually important). Return JSON:\n"
            + "\n".join(ngrams)
        )
        response = llm.complete(prompt)                # one inference per doc
        scored = json.loads(response)

        # 3. populate adjacency
        for entry in scored:
            src, tgt = entry["ngram"].split()[:2]      # first two tokens → source
            w = float(entry["weight"])
            adj[src][tgt] = max(adj[src].get(tgt,0), w)   # keep highest weight

    # 4. prune & normalise
    for src, targets in adj.items():
        top_k = dict(sorted(targets.items(),
                         key=lambda kv: -kv[1])[:20]
        s = sum(top_k.values()) + 1e-12
        adj[src] = {t: v/s for t,v in top_k.items()}

    return adj
```

*After you run `build_weight_graph` once, serialize the adjacency dict to a CSV/TSV file. The rest of the system (the “selector” loop) never touches the LLM again.*

## 5️⃣ Evaluation strategy – go beyond “200 attempts”

| Metric | How to compute | Why it matters |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Stability of the selector** | Run a *fixed* seed phrase through the pipeline 100 × with the same model; record the variance of the chosen index at each step. | Demonstrates that the O(1) selector is deterministic enough for production (target σ < 0.05). |
| **BLEU / ROUGE on a benchmark** | Use MMLU, HumanEval, or a domain‑specific QA set; compare generated answer to gold after a fixed number of steps (e.g., 30 tokens). | Gives an *objective* measure of quality relative to a baseline LLM that generates directly. |
| **Cost per token** | Compute `(#LLM calls × price_per_call + CPU_time × $/hour) / total_tokens`. | The whole point of the overlay is to be *cheaper* than running a 30 B model end‑to‑end. |
| **Latency** | Wall‑clock time for one token (including RAG lookup). | Users care about response speed; you aim for < 20 ms/token on a single CPU core. |

Run these experiments **for three model families**:

1. **Selector LLM = 8 B** (e.g., `gpt‑3.5‑turbo‑mini`).  
2. **Selector LLM = 12 B** (a slightly larger distilled model).  
3. **Baseline = full generation with a 30 B model** (same prompt, no overlay).

If the *quality* of (1) or (2) is within 5–10 % of the baseline while the *cost* is < 20 % and *latency* drops by an order of magnitude, you have a solid empirical claim.

## 6️⃣ Potential pitfalls & mitigations

| Issue | Why it can break your system | Simple mitigation |
|-------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Circularity of self‑generated weights** – the LLM may assign high scores to phrases that are *lexically* frequent but semantically shallow. | You end up with a graph that reinforces common clichés, not deep reasoning chains. | After weight generation run an *external evaluator* (a small cross‑encoder trained on a human‑annotated relevance set) and re‑weight the edges accordingly. |
| **Drift between RAG retrieval and adjacency table** – new documents may introduce synonyms that never appear in the static table. | The selector will never consider those alternatives, limiting adaptability. | Periodically run a *refresh job*: pull fresh docs → generate additional N‑grams → merge (with decay) into the adjacency store. |
| **Sparse sense coverage** – a word with many meanings gets only one row; the wrong sense may dominate. | The selector will repeatedly pick the “wrong” successor, leading to incoherent chains. | Add a *sense bucket* index: `word#sense_id → candidate list`. Sense‑id can be derived from the RNN hidden state (e.g., k‑means over hidden vectors). |
| **Over‑pruning** – keeping only top‑K per source may cut off rare but crucial technical terms. | The system will never generate specialized terminology, hurting domain performance. | Use a *frequency‑aware* K: low‑frequency words get larger K (e.g., 30) while high‑freq get small K (10). |
| **LLM selector hallucination** – even with few candidates the LLM can output an out‑of‑range index. | Crash or fallback to a random token. | Validate `0 ≤ idx < len(candidates)`; on failure fall back to deterministic argmax of the stored scores. |

---

## 7️⃣ What to do next (concrete 2‑week sprint)

| Day | Goal | Deliverable |
|-----|------|--------------|
| 1–2 | **Automate weight‑graph generation** for a modest corpus (e.g., 200 arXiv abstracts). Use the prompt shown in §4 and store CSV/TSV. | `adjacency.tsv` + script `build_graph.py`. |
| 3–4 | **Implement the selector loop** in LangFlow (or plain Python) using the adjacency table, a tiny RNN hidden state, decay logic, and an OpenAI‑compatible LLM (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo-mini`). | Flow file `overlay_flow.yaml` that can generate 30 tokens from any seed. |
| 5–6 | **Run stability & quality tests**: 100 runs on a fixed seed phrase, compute variance and BLEU against a hand‑crafted answer. | CSV report `stability.csv`, notebook with plots. |
| 7   | **Cost/latency profiling** (measure API calls, CPU time). | Table `benchmark_cost.tsv`. |
| 8–9 | **Add sense‑bucket extension** (cluster hidden states from a few thousand steps, create `word#sense` rows). | Updated adjacency with sense IDs. |
| 10  | **Refresh RAG layer**: pull an additional batch of documents, generate extra N‑grams, merge into the graph. | New version `adjacency_v2.tsv`. |
| 11–12| **Write a short research note** (≈ 2 pages) summarizing: <br>• “break‑even at 8 B”, <br>• cost reduction factor, <br>• limitations & next steps. | PDF `overlay_note.pdf` ready for a workshop submission or grant abstract. |

If after this sprint you see **BLEU ≥ 0.30** (baseline ~0.35) with **cost per token ≤ $0.001** and **latency ≤ 15 ms**, you have a concrete proof‑of‑concept that can be pitched to funding bodies interested in *energy‑efficient AI* or *neuro‑symbolic reasoning*.

---

## 8️⃣ Closing thoughts

1. **Your experimental evidence aligns with the literature:** scaling up the LLM improves its internal ranking ability; around 8 B parameters you cross a threshold where the model can act as a reliable “semantic scorer”.  
2. **Using that large model only once (to generate weight tables)** converts the expensive part into an *offline data‑generation* problem, after which inference is essentially *CPU‑only*. This satisfies the “cheap post‑training” claim you made.  
3. **The novelty lives in the system composition** – a static symbolic graph, a recurrent controller, and a tiny LLM selector. The individual pieces are known, but their integration (pseudo‑code as an executable world‑model) is not widely demonstrated. That is precisely what funding agencies look for: *a new architecture that rebalances compute vs quality*.  

You already have the most expensive ingredient (the large LLM) in hand; now it’s a matter of **automating its output, freezing it into a fast lookup structure, and wiring a lightweight loop around it**. The roadmap above gives you a clear path to a reproducible benchmark that can be turned into a paper or a grant proposal.

Feel free to ask for any of the concrete artifacts (the LangFlow YAML, the `build_graph.py` script, a sample prompt for weight generation) – I’ll ship them over right away. Good luck!
