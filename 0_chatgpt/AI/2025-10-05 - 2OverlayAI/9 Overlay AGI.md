Я хочу, чтобы проходя по всем 100к токенам, алгоритм собирал из БД смысловых продолжений для каждого слова наборы слов, и склеил в единый лист, пусть даже это будет 100 000 слов, не важно. И делал арифметические операции сложения весов. В итоге получив таблицу весов уже для генерации. После генерации каждого слова, на основе последнего слова нового берется его стоковая таблица, и прибавляется. Что скажешь по такому алгоритму?

## 1. What the algorithm does – a short restatement

| Phase | What you propose |
|------|-------------------|
| **Offline build** | Scan the entire 100 000‑token knowledge base once. For every *source word* `w` collect a **candidate list** `C(w) = { (c₁, s₁), … , (c_k, s_k) }` where each `c_i` is a possible continuation and `s_i` is a *semantic weight* (e.g., cosine similarity, expert rank). |
| **Merge step** | Concatenate all those candidate lists into one gigantic list `U = ⋃_{w∈V} C(w)` (size ≈ 100 000 entries, maybe more if you keep several candidates per word).|
| **Weight aggregation** | For every *target token* `t` compute a **global score**  <br> `S(t) = Σ_{(w,c,s)∈U , c=t} s`. In other words: add up all the weights that point to `t` from any source word. |
| **Generation loop** | Start with an initial seed token `w₀`. Emit the most (or a stochastic sample of) token(s) according to the current global scores. After you output a new word `w_n`, *retrieve its own candidate list* `C(w_n)` and **add** those weights to the running accumulator `S(·)`. Then repeat. |

In short: **global weight table = sum of all per‑word continuation tables**, updated incrementally after each step.

---

## 2. How this relates to known language‑model ideas

| Known concept | Correspondence |
|---------------|----------------|
| **n‑gram (Markov) models** | `C(w)` is the *conditional distribution* P(next | w). Your global table `S(·)` is simply a *raw count* version of that distribution, summed over all observed contexts. |
| **Interpolation / smoothing** (e.g., Kneser‑Ney) | Adding the per‑word tables together is an extreme form of interpolation: you treat every source word as an “expert” and combine their opinions linearly. |
| **Mixture‑of‑Experts** | Each `C(w)` can be seen as an expert that votes for its continuations; the global accumulator is the mixture output. |
| **Back‑off models** | You are effectively *back‑off* to a unigram model after each step, because you discard the specific source word once its contributions have been added to `S`. |

So the algorithm isn’t brand new—it’s an **explicit, deterministic variant of classic probabilistic language modelling**, with the twist that the per‑word weights are **semantic similarity scores** (instead of raw frequencies) and you *re‑accumulate* them after each generated token.

---

## 3. Strengths of the proposal

| Aspect | Why it helps |
|--------|--------------|
| **Deterministic O(1) lookup** | After the offline phase, `C(w)` is a simple hash‑map; retrieving it costs constant time. |
| **No neural inference at generation time** | The only arithmetic you do online is addition of pre‑computed floats – negligible CPU cost. |
| **Semantic weighting** | By using embedding similarity (or expert rank) rather than raw counts, you bias the model toward *meaningful* continuations, not just frequency artefacts. |
| **Incremental refinement** | Each new word contributes its own “expert votes”, so the distribution slowly drifts toward a region of the semantic space that is consistent with what has already been said. |
| **Explainability** | Every contribution to `S(t)` can be traced back to a concrete source‑word → you have an audit trail for why a particular word was chosen. |

If your goal is *fast, lightweight generation* from a closed knowledge pool, the design satisfies it.

---

## 4. Weaknesses & pitfalls (why it may not meet all expectations)

| Problem | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Loss of long‑range context** | After you add `C(w_n)` to the global table, the *source word* is forgotten; only its votes remain. The model cannot enforce that two distant words must agree (e.g., subject–verb agreement) because there’s no mechanism to keep a structured state. |
| **Bias toward high‑degree nodes** | Tokens that appear in many `C(w)` lists (common connectors, stop‑words) will accumulate huge scores unless you explicitly down‑weight them (e.g., apply inverse‑document‑frequency or a temperature). |
| **Memory blow‑up if `k` is large** | If you store, say, the top 50 candidates per source word for a vocab of 30 k tokens → ~1.5 M edges. That’s still fine on modern RAM, but it grows quadratically with `k`. |
| **Weight saturation / numeric overflow** | Repeated addition without normalization will make the scores diverge rapidly; after a few hundred steps you’ll need to renormalize (e.g., divide all `S(·)` by their sum) or work in log‑space. |
| **Deterministic output → boring** | If you always pick the highest‑scoring token, the stream quickly collapses into a high‑weight “hub” word and loops. A stochastic sampling step (softmax with temperature) is essential for diversity. |
| **No handling of multi‑word phrases** | The model only knows *single‑token* continuations. Real language often requires collocations (“strongly correlated”, “machine learning”). You could augment `C(w)` to contain multi‑token n‑grams, but that inflates the table further. |
| **Semantic similarity alone may be insufficient** | Cosine similarity of static embeddings captures *topic* but not syntactic compatibility (e.g., “eat” → “apple” vs. “eat” → “quickly”). You would need an additional *syntactic filter* (POS tags, dependency patterns). |

---

## 5. How to make the algorithm robust

Below is a **conceptual checklist** you can apply after you have built `C(w)`:

| Step | What to do | Why |
|------|------------|-----|
| **1️⃣ Cap per‑word list size** | Keep only the top K (e.g., 20) candidates for each source word. | Controls memory, forces higher quality. |
| **2️⃣ Apply a *frequency penalty*** | Multiply each weight `s` by `idf(w)` or by `1 / log(freq(c)+1)`. | Prevents stop‑words from dominating the global table. |
| **3️⃣ Normalise after every addition** | After adding `C(w_n)` to `S`, compute `Z = Σ_t S(t)` and set `P(t)=S(t)/Z`. Optionally use a *temperature* τ: `Pτ(t) ∝ P(t)^{1/τ}`. | Keeps probabilities in [0,1] and introduces stochasticity. |
| **4️⃣ Add a *back‑off hierarchy*** | Keep also a *bigram* table `C₂(w_{i-1}, w_i)`; if the current word has few high‑quality continuations, fall back to the unigram‑style global table. | Restores some short‑range syntactic coherence. |
| **5️⃣ Introduce *decay* of old votes** | After each step multiply all scores by a factor `γ < 1` (e.g., 0.99). | Guarantees that early words don’t forever dominate the distribution, allowing the narrative to drift. |
| **6️⃣ Optionally merge multi‑token candidates** | Store `(c₁ c₂, s)` as a *phrase* entry; when sampling you can emit two tokens at once and shift the window accordingly. | Handles collocations without exploding the graph. |
| **7️⃣ Validate on a small held‑out set** | Generate 1 000‑token samples, compute perplexity or BLEU against a reference corpus to see whether the distribution is reasonable. | Gives you an empirical signal for tuning K, penalties, decay, temperature. |

All of these operations are *O(|V|)* at most (a single pass over the vocabulary) and can be performed **once per generation step** because `S` lives in memory as a dense or sparse vector.

---

## 6. A concrete high‑level flow (no code, just logical steps)

1. **Preprocess**
   - Tokenise the 100 k corpus → vocab `V`.
   - For every token `w∈V` compute its embedding `e(w)`.
   - Build a *nearest‑neighbour* list `N(w)` of size `K` (semantic similarity).
   - Attach any **expert rank** `r(w)` you have (0–10).

2. **Create per‑word continuation tables**
   - For each `w`, produce `C(w) = { (c, s = α·cos(e(w),e(c)) + β·r(c)) | c∈N(w) }`.
   - Store as a hash map: `{ w → [(c₁,s₁)…] }`.

3. **Initial global accumulator**
   - `S(t) ← 0` for all `t∈V`.

4. **Seed the generator**
   - Choose start token `w₀`.
   - Retrieve `C(w₀)` and add its scores to `S`: `S(c) += s` for each `(c,s)∈C(w₀)`.

5. **Iterative step (repeat as long as you like)**
   6. **Normalize**: compute probability distribution `P(t)=softmax(S/τ)`.
   7. **Sample** a token `w_next ~ P(·)`.  
      - If you prefer deterministic output, pick `argmax(P)`.
   8. **Emit** the word (write to file / stream).  
   9. **Update accumulator**: retrieve `C(w_next)` and add its scores: `S(c) += s` for each `(c,s)∈C(w_next)`.  
   10. **Optional decay**: multiply all `S` by `γ` (e.g., 0.99) to keep the sum bounded.

11. **Loop terminates** when you hit a user‑defined length or an explicit stop token appears.

Because each iteration does:
- One hash lookup (`C(w_next)`),
- At most `K` float additions,
- A softmax over `|V|` (which can be made cheap by keeping `S` in *log space* and updating only the changed entries),

the per‑token cost stays **constant or near‑constant**.

---

## 7. Comparison with a classic n‑gram model

| Feature | Classic n‑gram (frequency) | Your semantic‑weight + additive scheme |
|---------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Data source | Raw counts of observed bigrams | Embedding similarity + optional expert rank |
| Smoothing | Kneser‑Ney, Good‑Turing | Weight addition is a built‑in smoothing (every word gets votes from many sources) |
| Context length | Fixed (order = n‑1) | Effectively *unbounded*: every generated token adds its own whole neighbourhood, so the distribution evolves with the entire history. |
| Explainability | Count → probability easy to trace | Each weight can be traced back to a concrete similarity edge + rank; you can even output “*the word ‘entropy’ was chosen because 12 neighbours voted for it*”. |
| Computational load (generation) | O(1) lookup + division | Same O(1) plus a softmax over the whole vocab (which is cheap if you keep a running total). |

So your scheme can be viewed as **a semantically‑enriched, continuously‑interpolated n‑gram model**.

---

## 8. When will it *fail* to produce coherent text?

- **Highly structured tasks** (e.g., programming code) demand strict syntax and long‑range dependencies; a pure additive scheme cannot enforce indentation levels or variable binding.
- **Narrative arcs** need planning over many sentences; the algorithm only knows what the most recent token contributed, so story coherence will degrade after a few hundred words unless you inject higher‑order constraints manually (e.g., a separate “plot planner” that periodically re‑initialises `S` with a new thematic seed).
- **Rare domain terminology** may never appear in any `C(w)` because the embedding neighbourhood of common words does not contain them; you’ll need to insert those terms explicitly into the candidate lists.

---

## 9. Bottom line – is the algorithm worth pursuing?

| Criterion | Verdict |
|-----------|---------|
| **Speed / resource footprint** | ✅ Excellent – after offline build, generation runs on a single CPU core in sub‑millisecond per token. |
| **Semantic relevance (vs pure frequency)** | ✅ Good, provided you have high‑quality embeddings and/or expert ranks. |
| **Long‑range coherence** | ⚠️ Weak; you’ll need an auxiliary mechanism (topic controller, hierarchical planner) to keep a story or code consistent over many steps. |
| **Explainability / audit trail** | ✅ Very strong – every weight addition is traceable to a concrete source word and similarity score. |
| **Scalability of the offline phase** | ✅ Feasible for 100 k‑token corpora; for millions of tokens you may need to prune neighbours or use approximate nearest‑neighbour structures (FAISS, HNSW). |

If your primary goal is **fast, deterministic, semantically‑guided text generation without any neural inference at run time**, the algorithm is a solid foundation.  
If you also require *deep planning* or *structured output* (code, proofs), treat this generator as **a low‑level lexical engine** and place a higher‑level planner on top of it (e.g., a small LLM that decides when to re‑seed `S` with a new thematic vector).

---

### Quick “starter” implementation checklist

1. **Build vocabulary & embeddings** (`sentence-transformers`, `fasttext`).  
2. **For each token, store its top‑K neighbours + weight** in a JSON/SQLite table – this is the *static per‑word lookup*.  
3. **Create an empty accumulator vector `S`** (numpy float array of size `|V|`).  
4. **Write a loop** that:
   - Samples from `softmax(S)`,
   - Emits token,
   - Retrieves its neighbour list and adds the weights,
   - Optionally decays `S`.
5. **Validate** on a small test set (e.g., generate 1 000 tokens, compute perplexity against held‑out text).  
6. **Tune** hyper‑parameters (`K`, `α/β` for similarity vs rank, decay γ, temperature τ) until the output feels coherent enough for your use case.

That’s all you need to get a working prototype of the algorithm you described. Happy building!
