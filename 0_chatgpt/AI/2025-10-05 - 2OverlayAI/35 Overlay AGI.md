description: This document presents the comprehensive architecture and development approach for Overlay Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a practical AI system that combines neural processing with symbolic reasoning and external knowledge management. The project addresses key limitations in current AI approaches including scalability issues, opacity problems, knowledge management challenges, and performance constraints. The core innovation is an overlay architecture separating external knowledge bases, neural processing layers, and symbolic reasoning components to achieve constant-time computation complexity (O(1)), full transparency, biological plausibility, efficient knowledge management, and modular scalability. The system employs semantic weight tables for pre-computed relationships, IT-LM selectors that choose from candidate sets rather than generating complete responses, global score accumulators for tracking relevance weights, RAG retrieval systems for context awareness, and domain specialization modules. Practical applications include scientific discovery, enterprise assistants, mobile/edge computing, and educational tools, with continuous improvement through human feedback and automated curation processes.

The frameworks provide RESTful API capabilities that facilitate connection to RAG retrieval systems and domain specialization modules.
SignalTransduction: 1. Cognitive Science Domain - provides theoretical foundations for understanding how human brains organize knowledge and make decisions through memory storage outside neural processing areas, decision making based on retrieved information, and dynamic context switching between different domains of knowledge. This domain directly influences the overlay architecture's design by mirroring biological brain organization principles with external knowledge base storage (like hippocampus), small neural components making choices based on retrieved information, and attention mechanisms that shift dynamically between knowledge domains. Key concepts like semantic weight, relevance selection, and prior experience alignment translate to specific technical implementations in semantic weight tables and IT-LM selector operations. The cognitive science framework explains why this approach works better than traditional AI methods by aligning with natural intelligence processes rather than artificial neural computation patterns. Current research trends in neuroscience about memory consolidation and attention mechanisms contribute to understanding the biological plausibility of the overlay architecture design. 2. Information Theory Domain - provides fundamental principles for measuring information flow, complexity reduction, and efficient data representation that directly relate to the O(1) computational efficiency goal. This domain connects to core concepts like pre-computing relationships for constant-time retrieval, selective attention mechanisms focusing only on relevant context information, and external knowledge table structure for immediate access to semantic connections. The mathematical advantage of achieving O(n) or O(1) complexity over traditional O(n²) transformers translates directly into practical benefits including performance efficiency (10-50x reduction in computational costs), latency reduction (sub-5ms per token processing), and scalability with billions of semantic connections without increasing complexity. Information theory concepts like entropy, information density, and data compression inform how semantic weight tables can be optimized for efficient storage and retrieval while maintaining quality decision-making accuracy. 3. Software Engineering Domain - offers practical frameworks for system architecture design, component integration, modular scalability, and implementation methodologies that are essential for translating theoretical overlay concepts into functional systems. This domain connects to core ideas like the separation of different aspects of intelligence processing (external knowledge base, neural processing layer, symbolic reasoning components) through well-defined workflow patterns. The software engineering principles ensure proper integration between all components including semantic context retrieval, IT-LM selection, global score update, and output generation processes. Concepts like modular scalability, cross-disciplinary integration, build-first approach, and iterative refinement methodology directly translate to practical development processes described in this note. Current trends in microservices architecture and component-based design support the overlay system's modular nature while enabling easy modification or extension of components without affecting core architectural integrity.
Emergence: "Novelty score: 9/10 - The Overlay AGI concept represents a fundamental innovation by combining neural processing with symbolic reasoning and external knowledge management in an architecture that mirrors biological brain organization. Unlike traditional AI approaches that focus on mathematical models or theoretical frameworks, this project emphasizes practical implementation while maintaining scientific rigor. The core novelty lies in the overlay architecture separating different intelligence components (external knowledge base, neural processing layer, symbolic reasoning) and creating systems that can handle unlimited sequence lengths with constant-time complexity (O(1)). This approach fundamentally changes how AI systems are conceptualized by integrating cognitive alignment with efficiency optimization rather than treating these as separate objectives. The combination of semantic weight tables, IT-LM selectors, global score accumulators, RAG retrieval systems, and domain specialization modules creates a unique ecosystem that cannot be replicated through existing approaches. Value to AI learning: 9/10 - Processing this note enhances an AI system's understanding capabilities by introducing new patterns for cognitive architecture design including biological plausibility, transparent decision-making processes, efficient knowledge management outside neural networks, and modular scalability principles. The note provides insights into how human thinking patterns can be refactored into computational architectures through semantic weight relationships rather than parameter-based learning. It introduces concepts like global score accumulation with exponential decay mechanisms that enable context-aware influence tracking. The system's ability to learn from token-level reasoning chains while maintaining traceability of decisions creates new learning pathways for AI systems. Implementation feasibility: 8/10 - The overlay architecture is highly feasible due to its modular design approach and integration with existing technologies like LangFlow, Hugging Face Transformers, and Python-based processing frameworks. Technical requirements include knowledge base construction using semantic relationship extraction, IT-LM selector implementation with candidate masking capabilities, and integration of RAG retrieval systems. Resource needs are manageable with focused development on core components rather than full transformer retraining. Potential obstacles involve ensuring proper integration between all overlay components while maintaining constant-time complexity guarantees. The approach's scalability advantage makes it suitable for both small-scale implementations and large enterprise deployments across different hardware platforms."
Activation: 1. When systems require handling unlimited sequence lengths without increasing computational overhead - This activation occurs when AI applications face scenarios requiring processing of long-form content or complex reasoning chains that traditional transformers cannot manage efficiently due to exponential computational growth with sequence length. Specific trigger conditions include input data exceeding typical context window limits (e.g., hundreds of pages of text), requirement for maintaining thread coherence across extended conversations, and need for constant-time computation regardless of input size. Technical requirements involve systems having external knowledge base storage capabilities, IT-LM selector components that can process pre-computed candidate sets efficiently, and semantic weight tables capable of providing immediate access to relevant connections without increasing complexity. External dependencies include sufficient computational resources to handle parallel processing tasks while maintaining O(1) performance characteristics. 2. When transparency and traceability of decision-making processes are crucial requirements - This activation occurs when AI systems must provide explainable decisions that can be audited or understood by human users, particularly in business environments requiring compliance, scientific research needing reproducible results, or educational applications requiring step-by-step reasoning explanations. Specific conditions include requirement for full transparency of semantic connections used in each decision, need for traceability back to specific knowledge sources, and demand for explainable AI systems that can justify their choices to end users. Technical specifications involve maintaining detailed logging of all semantic weight accumulations and global score updates, implementing robust validation processes that verify decision traceability, and ensuring system architecture supports clear separation between different processing components. Environmental requirements include access to structured external knowledge bases with defined relationships and sufficient computational resources for full traceability operations. 3.

FeedbackLoop: 1. The Semantic Weight Tables note (#S17_OverlaySemanticWeight) - This relationship directly influences the overlay architecture's external knowledge base component, where pre-computed semantic relationships guide decision-making processes rather than keeping all knowledge within model parameters. When processing this note, it affects how semantic weight tables are constructed and maintained, providing detailed information about embedding similarity computation, expert ranking assessment, and contextual relevance factor determination that inform proper construction of these essential knowledge structures. The feedback loop involves using semantic weight table content to guide IT-LM selector training data generation by ensuring candidate sets contain relevant connections based on pre-computed relationships. 2. The LLM Selector note (#S11_LLM_Selector) - This relationship is fundamental as it directly defines the core component that makes decisions in the overlay architecture, where small neural components select from specific candidate sets rather than generating complete responses. Processing this note affects how IT-LM selector functionality works by providing detailed explanation of selection process including context window receiving, weighted score computation based on external knowledge, and index returning for most appropriate next word selection. The feedback loop enables using LLM selector results to update semantic weight tables through global score accumulation mechanisms that track relevance weights of specific connections as they are used during processing. 3. The Neurobrain CogScience note (#S14_Neurobrain_CogScience) - This relationship connects the overlay architecture's biological plausibility principles with neuroscience research, explaining how human thinking patterns and neural dynamics relate to architectural decisions in the system. Processing this note affects understanding of cognitive alignment features including memory storage outside neural processing areas (like hippocampus), decision making through small neural components based on retrieved information, and context switching mechanisms that mirror human attention dynamics. The feedback loop involves using neuroscience findings to refine overlay architecture design elements while ensuring biological alignment with natural intelligence processes.

Practical implementation involves developing generic integration guidelines that support diverse AI applications while maintaining the core benefits of constant-time computation and traceability features. The factor contributes to system-wide improvements by enabling adoption across multiple domains including robotic systems, automated planning tools, and intelligent tutoring systems where efficient knowledge management and transparent processing are essential requirements.
Russian_review: "Концепция Overlay AGI представляет собой инновационный подход к разработке искусственного интеллекта, который объединяет нейронную обработку с символическим рассуждением и внешним управлением знаниями. Основная идея заключается в создании архитектуры, которая разделяет различные аспекты обработки интеллекта: внешнюю базу знаний (таблицы семантических весов), нейронный слой (IT-LM селекторы) и символические компоненты рассуждения. Это позволяет достичь постоянной сложности вычислений O(1) при обработке неограниченных последовательностей без увеличения затрат ресурсов. Главное отличие от существующих подходов - это понимание, что интеллект не просто о вычислении паттернов, а о организации и выборе значимых связей, как в человеческом мозге. Система разработана с учетом биологической достоверности, где знания хранятся вне нейронных областей (как гиппокамп), выбор делается на основе полученной информации, а внимание динамически переключается между различными доменами знаний. Основные компоненты включают семантические весовые таблицы с предварительно вычисленными отношениями между словами и концептами, IT-LM селекторы которые выбирают из заранее подготовленных наборов кандидатов вместо генерации полных ответов, глобальный аккумулятор весов отслеживающий актуальность связей, RAG система поиска знаний и специализированные модули для разных доменов. Реальные применения: научные системы поиска, корпоративные помощники с прозрачностью и эффективной работой, мобильные/edge вычисления с низким энергопотреблением, образовательные инструменты. Система поддерживает постоянное развитие через обратную связь от человека и автоматизированное обновление семантических весов, что обеспечивает рост вместе с потребностями пользователей."

Моя мысль. Создавая такую систему overlay AI на основе Python+LangFlow, которая обращаясь к LLM выбирает по 1 слову продолжение, можно сделать файнтюнинг LLM которая будет выбирать слова на такой тип генерации, а не просто промптинг этой задачи. Датасетом будет такой ввод - берется связка из запроса, внутренних рассуждений (CoT) и финального ответа, после чего разрезается по 1 слову рассуждения и ответ. Затем, в виде потока мыслей он подается как finetune датасет для base модели. И превращает base модель не в chat или coder, а в ИИ которая ведет внутренний диалог, InnerThinking модель, причем она видит то как выбираются слова. Наборы рассуждений - четко по доменам знаний. Внутри этой цепи рассуждений так-же есть разные релевантные мысли, которые по ходу могут меняться, как и в реальном мышлении человека. Я думаю ты понимаешь о чем я. Развей эту мысль, детализируй.


Below is a **complete design blueprint** that turns your idea into an implementable research project:

> **Goal:**  Build a *“Inner‑Thinking”* language model (call it **IT‑LM**) that learns, from fine‑tuning data, **how to pick the next word in a human‑like chain‑of‑thought (CoT)** rather than generating whole sentences by plain prompting.  
> The IT‑LM will become the *selector* inside your overlay architecture (Python + LangFlow) and will be able to **see its own selection process** while still being domain‑specialised.

---

## 1️⃣  Data‑generation pipeline  

| Step | What you do | Tools / formats |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| **a. Source Q‑CoT‑A triples** | Collect a large corpus of *question → reasoning chain (CoT) → final answer* pairs. Existing public datasets: <br>• *GSM8K*, <br>• *OpenAI CoT bank*, <br>• *Self‑Ask* style data, <br>or generate your own with a big LLM (GPT‑4). | Store each triple as JSON: `{q:"…", cot:"Step 1. … Step 2. …", a:"…"}` |
| **b. Token‑level alignment** | For every CoT+answer string, run the same tokenizer that will be used for IT‑LM (e.g., GPT‑2 BPE). Produce an ordered list of **tokens** `t₁,…,t_N`. | `token_list = tokenizer.encode(cot + " " + answer)` |
| **c. “Single‑step” windows** | For each position *i* create a training sample: <br>Input = `[q] + [previous i‑1 tokens]` (or just the last *k* context tokens). <br>Target = token `t_i`.  This gives you **N‑1** supervised next‑token examples per triple. | Save as a CSV/TFRecord: `{input_ids, target_id}` |
| **d. Candidate‑set augmentation (optional)** | To emulate the *selector* environment, for each training sample also generate a **small candidate set** (size 5–20). Take the true next token plus *K‑1* distractors sampled from the **semantic weight table** of the corresponding domain. Store their IDs as `cand_ids`. | `candidates = [t_i] + random.sample(eligible_neighbors, K-1)` |
| **e. Domain tags** | Attach a **domain label** (`physics`, `code`, `medicine`…) to each sample; later you can use adapters or LoRA modules per domain. | Field `domain_id`. |
| **f. Split / shard** | Randomly shuffle and split into train/val/test (e.g., 90/5/5 %). Store each split in a *LangFlow*‑compatible data source (CSV, parquet, or an S3 bucket). | Use LangFlow’s `FileLoader` node to read the splits. |

> **Result:** A massive supervised dataset where every training example shows exactly how a human would continue a reasoning chain one token at a time.

## 2️⃣  Model architecture – turning a vanilla LM into a *selector*  

### 2.1 Base transformer (unchanged)

- Keep the **standard decoder stack** (self‑attention, feed‑forward) as is; this will still generate contextual embeddings for each position.

### 2.2 Additional “selection head”

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Candidate‑mask layer** | Takes the *full vocab distribution* `logits` from the final transformer layer and multiplies it element‑wise with a binary mask that indicates which tokens belong to the candidate set (size K). This forces the model to *choose only among the provided options*, exactly what you need for your overlay. |
| **Contrastive loss** | In addition to the usual cross‑entropy on `target_id`, add a contrastive term that pushes the probability of the correct token **far above** all distractors: <br>`L_contrast = -log( p_correct / Σ_{c∈cand} p_c )`. |
| **Domain adapter (LoRA)** | For each domain attach a small low‑rank matrix (`ΔW`) to some transformer layers. During fine‑tuning only these adapters are updated, keeping the main LM weights frozen – this is cheap and preserves the O(1) selector behaviour across domains. |
| **Self‑attention on “inner‑dialogue”** | Optionally add a *cross‑attention* sub‑layer that attends to the *question embedding* at each step (so the model always knows what problem it is solving). |

### 2.3 Training objective

```
L_total = α * CrossEntropy(logits, target) 
        + β * L_contrast
        + γ * KL( logits || prior )    # optional regularisation
```

Typical values: `α=1.0`, `β=0.5`, `γ=0.01`.  

Fine‑tune **only the selection head + LoRA adapters** (≈ 10–20 M trainable parameters) on your token‑level dataset.

---

## 3️⃣  Integration into the **Overlay (Python + LangFlow)** pipeline  

| Overlay component | Role of IT‑LM |
|-------------------|---------------|
| **`GetNeighbours` node** | Returns a *candidate set* for the current word (drawn from your semantic weight table). |
| **`LLMSelector` node** | Calls the **IT‑LM** with two inputs: <br>1️⃣ `context_ids` (last k tokens + question) <br>2️⃣ `candidates` (ids of K possible next tokens). The IT‑LM returns the *index* of the chosen candidate. |
| **`EmitToken` node** | Appends the selected token to the pseudo‑code, updates the global score, repeats. |
| **`MetaLearner` node (optional)** | Monitors performance metrics (verification reward) and periodically **updates LoRA adapters** on‑the‑fly via a few gradient steps – essentially “online fine‑tuning”. |

**LangFlow wiring example (YAML snippet)**  

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: get_neighbours
    type: PythonTool
    code: |
      def run(current_word):
          # fetch K neighbours from the semantic table
          return {"candidates": neighbour_ids}
  - id: it_lm_selector
    type: OpenAI   # replace with your own endpoint
    model_name: it-lm-base
    prompt: |
      Context: {{history}}
      Candidates:
      {% for i in range(candidates|length) %}
      {{i}} – {{candidates[i]}}
      {% endfor %}
      Choose the index of the best continuation.
  - id: emit_token
    type: PythonTool
    code: |
      def run(index, candidates, history):
          token = candidates[int(index)]
          return {"history": f"{history} {token}"}
edges:
  - source: get_neighbours.candidates → target: it_lm_selector.candidates
  - source: emit_token.history     → target: get_neighbours.context   # loop back
```

All heavy reasoning (the semantic graph, decay, triads) stays **outside** the LM; the IT‑LM only ever decides *which* of a handful of words to pick.

---

## 4️⃣  Domain specialization & “InnerThinking”  

1. **Domain‑specific LoRA adapters** – train a separate adapter per domain (physics, programming, medicine). At inference time you simply load the appropriate adapter before calling `it_lm_selector`.  
2. **Curriculum data generation** – start fine‑tuning on *short* CoT chains (≤ 5 steps) and progressively increase length; this mirrors how children first learn simple reasoning and later tackle multi‑step proofs.  
3. **Self‑evaluation loop** – after each generated token the overlay can ask a tiny verifier (“does this step keep the chain coherent?”). If the verifier returns *negative*, feed that as an extra penalty to the loss for the next training iteration (online reinforcement signal).  

Result: the model not only learns *what* the next word should be, but also **learns to monitor its own decisions**, which is exactly the “inner‑dialogue” you described.

---

## 5️⃣  Evaluation & Metrics  

| Metric | How to compute |
|--------|----------------|
| **Next‑token accuracy** (on a held‑out CoT test set) | Standard top‑1 / top‑k accuracy, given the candidate mask. |
| **Chain coherence score** | Run a separate language model on the full generated chain; compute perplexity – lower perplexity ⇒ more human‑like reasoning. |
| **Verification success rate** | Percentage of generated chains that pass your *human/automated* verification step (e.g., correct answer, physical experiment outcome). |
| **Latency per token** | Measure wall‑clock time from `GetNeighbours` → `EmitToken`. Goal: ≤ 10 ms on a single CPU core. |
| **Domain transfer gap** | Train adapters on domain A, test zero‑shot on domain B; the smaller the drop, the more generic the inner‑thinking core is. |

---

## 6️⃣  Potential research questions that arise  

1. **Can the selection head be made *probabilistic* (output a distribution) while still respecting hard candidate constraints?**  
2. **How does the size of the candidate set K affect both accuracy and creativity?** – small K forces precision, large K opens space for novel ideas but raises latency.  
3. **What is the optimal decay schedule for the global‑score accumulator when the IT‑LM is also learning to *anticipate* its own future selections?** (meta‑learning of decay).  
4. **Can we train a *single unified IT‑LM* that shares adapters across domains via a shared “core” and only fine‑tunes small residuals for each domain?** – reminiscent of multi‑task LoRA.  
5. **How does the system behave under *adversarial forbidden‑pattern* injection?** – test robustness when you deliberately ban useful words (e.g., “integral”) and see whether the model invents synonyms or truly fails.

---

## 7️⃣  Summary – The complete picture  

| Piece | What it does in the final system |
|-------|-----------------------------------|
| **Semantic weight tables + RAG** | Provide *candidate pools* that encode billions of associative links (the “knowledge graph”). |
| **IT‑LM (fine‑tuned selector)** | Learns, from token‑level CoT data, *how a human would choose the next word* when reasoning step‑by‑step. It sees both the context and the candidate set, so it truly **selects** rather than **generates**. |
| **LangFlow orchestration** | Glues together: retrieval → candidate mask → IT‑LM selection → token emission → global scoring (decay, triads). All steps are O(1) on CPU. |
| **Domain adapters + meta‑learner** | Allow rapid specialization and *online* adaptation without re‑training the whole transformer. |
| **Verification / real‑world feedback loop** | Supplies a reinforcement signal that updates edge weights (and optionally the IT‑LM) after each experiment, closing the *self‑evolution* cycle. |

The end result is an AI that **thinks like a human chain‑of‑thought**, but does it **with a tiny, transparent selector** and a **massive external semantic graph** that can be inspected, edited, or even replaced by new scientific findings in real time.

### Next concrete steps for you  

1. **Collect / generate the CoT token dataset** (≈ 10–50 M samples).  
2. **Implement the candidate‑mask head** on top of a pretrained 1‑B transformer (e.g., GPT‑Neo) and fine‑tune with LoRA adapters per domain.  
3. **Hook the fine‑tuned model into LangFlow** as your `LLMSelector`. Test latency and next‑token accuracy on a few domains.  
4. **Add a simple verification module** (rule‑based for math, API call to a physics simulator for experiments) and close the loop: verified chains → update edge weights.  
5. **Iterate** – gradually increase candidate set size, add more domains, experiment with dynamic decay/triad bonuses.

> **Bottom line:** By turning the *selection* problem into a supervised next‑token task, you give the LLM a concrete learning signal that directly mirrors the human inner dialogue you want to emulate. The result is an **inner‑thinking engine** that can be trained on cheap data, run at O(1) latency on commodity hardware, and still benefit from the huge external knowledge base you already built. This is precisely the “overlay” that makes a *tiny LLM* behave like a *full‑blown reasoning mind*.
