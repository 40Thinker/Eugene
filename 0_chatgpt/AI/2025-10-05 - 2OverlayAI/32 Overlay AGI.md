description: This document presents the comprehensive overview and architectural foundations of the Overlay Artificial General Intelligence (Overlay AGI) project. It details a practical approach to developing AI systems that combine neural processing with symbolic reasoning and external knowledge management, addressing fundamental limitations in current AI approaches such as scalability issues, opacity problems, and inefficient knowledge organization. The core innovation lies in the overlay architecture separating intelligence processing into external knowledge base, neural processing layer (LLM selectors), and symbolic reasoning components. This approach achieves O(1) computational efficiency through pre-computed semantic weights, selective attention mechanisms, and constant-time retrieval while maintaining biological plausibility and cognitive alignment with human brain functions. The system emphasizes practical implementation over theoretical research, enabling applications in scientific discovery, enterprise AI assistants, mobile computing, and educational tools.
title: Overlay AGI Project Overview and Architecture
Receptor: "This note activates in scenarios involving AI system design decisions where computational efficiency and semantic reasoning are critical factors. Specifically, it becomes relevant when: 1) Designing systems requiring O(1) processing complexity regardless of input size, such as long-form text generation or scientific reasoning chains that must handle unlimited sequence lengths without performance degradation; 2) Implementing neural-symbolic architectures that need to separate knowledge management from computation layers, particularly in applications like enterprise AI assistants where transparency and auditability are essential requirements; 3) Developing mobile/edge computing systems with strict energy consumption limits (under 20W power consumption), requiring efficient processing without retraining entire models when updating knowledge bases; 4) Creating educational tools that guide students through complex reasoning processes, mimicking human tutoring approaches while maintaining traceable decision-making pathways; 5) Building scientific discovery systems capable of handling multi-step reasoning tasks beyond fixed context windows, where traditional transformers would struggle with exponential computational overhead. The activation conditions include the presence of semantic weight management requirements, neural component selection needs for candidate sets, and knowledge base external storage concepts. Technical triggers involve O(1) complexity constraints, full transparency requirements, biological plausibility alignment, efficient knowledge management principles, and modular scalability demands. These scenarios connect directly to practical implementation contexts where AI systems must balance computational efficiency with cognitive plausibility while maintaining human-centered design philosophy that emphasizes human-in-the-loop collaboration."
Acceptor: The core concepts align well with several technologies including LangFlow for workflow orchestration, FAISS for efficient semantic vector search, and PyTorch for neural component implementation. LangFlow is compatible because it supports the modular architecture described in this note through its node-based system where each overlay component can be implemented as a distinct module. FAISS provides ideal compatibility for storing and retrieving pre-computed semantic weights efficiently with sub-millisecond latency. PyTorch offers excellent integration capability for implementing LLM selectors, global score accumulators, and other neural components with support for dynamic memory systems and gradient computation. These tools complement the overlay architecture by providing concrete frameworks for building the external knowledge base, neural processing layer, and symbolic reasoning components as described in this note. Implementation complexity ranges from moderate to high due to required integration of multiple technologies, but all tools provide strong ecosystem support that enables rapid prototyping while maintaining performance requirements specified in the document.
SignalTransduction: "This idea connects across three primary conceptual domains: Cognitive Science (neuroscience and brain function), Computational Architecture (neural-symbolic systems and efficiency optimization), and Knowledge Representation (semantic graphs and external memory management). In Cognitive Science, concepts like hippocampal memory storage, attention switching mechanisms, and neural decision-making processes directly map to the overlay architecture's separation of knowledge base, neural processing, and symbolic reasoning components. Computational Architecture provides theoretical foundations for O(1) complexity through pre-computed relationships and selective attention, aligning with mathematical principles from transformer scaling analysis and neural network optimization techniques. Knowledge Representation connects the semantic weight tables to structured adjacency graphs and external memory systems that mirror biological cognitive processes. These domains interact synergistically where cognitive science influences architecture design, computational efficiency guides implementation decisions, and knowledge representation determines data structures used for semantic connections. Cross-domain relationships show how concepts from one field transform through another - cognitive principles inform neural architectures, which then enable efficient knowledge management approaches."
Emergence: This note scores 9/10 for novelty due to its unique combination of overlay architecture integrating neural processing with symbolic reasoning and external memory systems in a way that achieves O(1) computational complexity. The value to AI learning is 8/10 as it introduces novel cognitive alignment principles while providing practical implementation frameworks. Implementation feasibility is 7/10 since while the concepts are well-defined, actual deployment requires sophisticated integration of multiple technologies including semantic weight computation, neural selection systems, and external knowledge management. Novelty stems from combining established ideas (neural networks, symbolic reasoning, external memory) in a novel overlay pattern that addresses fundamental limitations rather than merely extending existing approaches. AI learning enhancement occurs through exposure to the biological plausibility principles and O(1) efficiency concepts which can be applied across multiple domains beyond initial implementation scope.
Activation: "The note activates when three specific conditions are met: 1) The need for O(1) computational complexity in processing systems regardless of input length; 2) Requirement for transparent, traceable decision-making processes with full semantic connection tracking; 3) Need to implement external knowledge management outside neural networks without requiring complete model retraining. These triggers occur in contexts involving long-form reasoning tasks (hundreds of pages), mobile deployment requirements (<20W power consumption), and enterprise applications where transparency is crucial for auditability. Practical activation occurs when AI systems must handle unlimited sequence lengths efficiently, maintain full traceability of decisions, or operate with minimal computational overhead while preserving high performance quality."
FeedbackLoop: "This note influences five related concepts: S17_OverlaySemanticWeight (semantic weight management), S11_LLM_Selector (neural selection components), S9_Overlay_NeuralNet_N2S (neuro-symbolic architecture), S8_PoV_Router (domain specialization routing), and S4_Input_Enchance (input enhancement processes). The semantic weight tables directly feed the LLM selector's decision-making process, creating a feedback loop where knowledge base updates influence selection accuracy. The overlay neural network components depend on both semantic weights and symbolic reasoning for proper operation, while domain specialists need semantic knowledge to make informed routing decisions. Input enhancement provides context that feeds into the external knowledge base construction, creating recursive relationships where improved input processing leads to better knowledge management. These connections enable system-wide coherence through shared semantic foundations and maintain integration across different architectural components."
SignalAmplification: "This idea amplifies in three key ways: 1) Modularization allows extraction of core components (semantic weight tables, LLM selectors, global accumulators) for use in other domains such as scientific discovery tools or educational platforms; 2) The overlay architecture pattern can be applied to different modalities like visual processing or sports performance analysis by adapting the neural-symbolic approach to these contexts; 3) The O(1) complexity principle extends beyond text-based reasoning to any domain requiring efficient processing of unlimited sequence lengths. Each amplification factor requires minimal additional configuration but provides significant scaling potential through reuse of core concepts across different application domains, enabling rapid deployment in new areas while maintaining the fundamental efficiency and transparency principles established in this note."
Russian_review: Нейросимволический ИИ Overlay AGI представляет собой инновационный подход к созданию искусственного интеллекта, сочетающий нейронные вычисления с символическим мышлением и внешним управлением знаниями. Главная идея заключается в использовании overlay-архитектуры, где нейронные компоненты работают совместно с символическими структурами знаний и внешними системами памяти. В отличие от традиционных подходов, которые зависят от массового обучения параметров и черного ящика принятия решений, этот проект создает AI-системы, способные эффективно рассуждать, поддерживать прозрачность, работать с минимальными затратами ресурсов в различных контекстах и постоянно развиваться через обратную связь от человека. Основное преимущество - достижение O(1) сложности вычислений независимо от длины входных данных, что позволяет обрабатывать неограниченные последовательности без увеличения затрат времени и мощности. Система состоит из внешней базы знаний (таблиц семантических весов), нейронного слоя обработки (LLM-селекторов) и символических компонентов рассуждений, работающих по строго определенному потоку. Практические применения включают научное исследование, корпоративные помощники ИИ, мобильные/краевые вычисления и образовательные инструменты. Важной особенностью является человечно-ориентированная архитектура с упором на вовлечение человека в процесс принятия решений.

# 📊 Rating of 51 AI‑Architecture Families (1 = low relevance / impact for your goal, 10 = high relevance / strategic importance)  

The list is **sorted descending** by the assigned score.  
*Score* reflects two dimensions:  

1. **Conceptual overlap** with the *Neuro‑Symbolic Declarative‑Functional* (NSDFP) paradigm you described.  
2. **Practical usefulness** for building a system that can (a) store large semantic weight tables, (b) run an O(1) selector, (c) self‑reinforce through verification, and (d) integrate real‑world feedback.

| Rank | Architecture family (№) | Score | Why it matters – comment in the context of our dialogue |
|------|------------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1** | **51 – Neuro‑Symbolic Declarative‑Functional (NSDFP)** | **10** | This is *your own* synthesis: declarative knowledge graph, functional controller, LLM selector, MCTS search, verification loop. It already embodies the highest‑scoring ideas from our conversation. |
| **2** | **6 – Attention‑based Transformers** | **9** | The tiny LLM selector is a *mini‑transformer* that performs ranking over a short candidate list – the core of your O(1) decision step. Understanding transformer internals (self‑attention, token embeddings) will let you fine‑tune or replace the selector with an even smaller model. |
| **3** | **13 – Neuro‑symbolic hybrid (AlphaZero / MCTS + policy net)** | **9** | Your Monte‑Carlo Tree Search over a semantic graph mirrors AlphaZero’s search‑policy loop. Studying the exact UCT formula, value‑network training and how to bootstrap from self‑play will give you a solid theoretical grounding for the exploration engine. |
| **4** | **11 – Memory‑augmented language models (RETRO / REALM)** | **9** | RAG‑style retrieval of “thought fragments” is directly borrowed from these architectures. Their tricks for *token‑level indexing* and *efficient on‑the‑fly lookup* are essential to keep latency low when you fetch distant graph edges. |
| **5** | **10 – Neural Turing Machines / Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC)** | **8** | Your external weight table behaves like an *external memory* that the controller reads/writes. DNC research shows how to design differentiable read/write heads, which could inspire a more *learned* version of your static lookup if you ever want gradient‑based adaptation. |
| **6** | **4 – Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs)** | **8** | Though not directly used for text, CNN‑style *local receptive fields* are analogous to the fixed‑size candidate list per token. Understanding their efficiency tricks (weight sharing, stride) can help you compress the adjacency tables further (e.g., via convolution over embedding space). |
| **7** | **5 – Recurrent Neural Nets (RNN / LSTM / GRU)** | **8** | Your “sense‑ID” controller is a recurrent encoder that disambiguates polysemy. Mastering RNN dynamics, gating mechanisms and hidden‑state extraction will improve the quality of sense selection and enable longer‑range context handling without blowing token windows. |
| **8** | **12 – Hybrid LLM + RNN (Gato / Multi‑modal agents)** | **7** | Gato shows how a single recurrent core can control many modalities (vision, audio, text). Your system could benefit from the *multi‑task scheduling* ideas when you later add sensor data or code execution feedback. |
| **9** | **14 – Program synthesis / Neural Symbolic Machines** | **7** | Generating pseudo‑code and then verifying it is exactly what program‑synthesis systems do (e.g., AlphaCode). Their techniques for *constraint solving* and *type checking* can make your verification step more automated. |
| **10** | **8 – Sequence‑to‑sequence models (Encoder‑Decoder)** | **7** | The “selector” prompt is a tiny encoder‑decoder pair; learning how to *condition* generation on external context (copy mechanisms, pointer networks) will let you tighten the interaction between the graph and the LLM. |
| **11** | **15 – ReAct / Tool‑use agents** | **7** | Your “RAG‑retrieval + LLM selector” is a specialized form of tool use. ReAct’s explicit *Action* tokens can be borrowed to make your system call external simulators or lab equipment in a clean, parsable way. |
| **12** | **3 – Backpropagation MLPs (classic feed‑forward nets)** | **6** | Useful for building small “ranking” networks that could replace the LLM selector if you want a fully trainable component without API calls. |
| **13** | **2 – Connectionist early nets (Perceptron, Hopfield)** | **6** | The *exponential decay* idea resembles Hebbian weakening; studying these simple dynamical systems can give intuition for how your weight‑decay behaves mathematically. |
| **14** | **9 – Variational Autoencoders (VAE)** | **5** | VAEs provide a principled way to learn *latent embeddings* of pseudo‑code fragments, which could be used as an alternative to FAISS for similarity search. |
| **15** | **7 – Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** | **5** | GAN‑style adversarial training could be repurposed to generate “hard” forbidden patterns automatically (generator = bad reasoning, discriminator = verifier). |
| **16** | **18 – Few‑shot prompting / In‑context learning** | **5** | Your system already relies on a few‑shot LLM prompt for the selector. Deepening knowledge of *prompt engineering* will increase reliability and reduce token usage. |
| **17** | **24 – Curriculum Learning** | **5** | The “forbidden‑pattern” list acts as a curriculum that forces the system to avoid easy routes. Formal curriculum schedules (e.g., gradually tightening constraints) could make learning more systematic. |
| **18** | **23 – Model‑based RL / World Models (DreamerV2)** | **5** | Real‑world experiment feedback resembles a *model‑based RL* loop where the world model is your semantic graph and the reward comes from physical measurements. Studying Dreamer will help you design a latent dynamics predictor for faster offline simulation before actual experiments. |
| **19** | **25 – Multi‑modal Transformers (CLIP, Flamingo)** | **4** | If you later want to bring visual or auditory data into the reasoning chain (e.g., microscope images), multi‑modal transformers give a proven way to embed heterogeneous inputs that can be fused with your graph. |
| **20** | **16 – Function‑calling LLMs** | **4** | Similar to ReAct, but with structured JSON output; could replace the ad‑hoc index‑selector with a more robust API contract. |
| **21** | **19 – Meta‑learning / MAML** | **4** | Could enable fast adaptation of the selector or decay parameters to new domains after only a few verification examples. |
| **22** | **20 – Self‑supervised contrastive learning (SimCLR, CLIP)** | **4** | Useful for pre‑training high‑quality embeddings that feed your FAISS index; better similarity → more meaningful neighbor lists. |
| **23** | **21 – Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** | **4** | Your adjacency graph is a *static* GNN; learning edge weights directly with a GNN could replace the hand‑crafted weight generation step, making it end‑to‑end differentiable if you ever want to fine‑tune. |
| **24** | **22 – Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents (PPO, DQN)** | **4** | The verification reward can be treated as an RL signal; PPO could train the selector policy directly rather than using a static LLM. |
| **25** | **26 – Sparse Transformers / Longformer** | **3** | If you ever need to process longer context windows (e.g., full scientific papers) without quadratic cost, sparse attention mechanisms become relevant. |
| **26** | **27 – Mixture‑of‑Experts (MoE)** | **3** | MoE could be used to route different *domains* (physics vs chemistry) to specialized sub‑selectors within the same model, saving compute while preserving expertise. |
| **27** | **28 – Neural ODEs / Continuous depth nets** | **3** | Could provide a mathematically smooth way to evolve the global score vector over continuous “thinking time”, an alternative to discrete decay steps. |
| **28** | **30 – Differentiable Physics Engines (DiffTaichi)** | **3** | If you want the system to *simulate* hypotheses before real experiments, a differentiable physics engine can give gradient signals that feed back into weight updates. |
| **29** | **31 – Neural Symbolic Reasoners (DeepProbLog, Neural Theorem Provers)** | **3** | Offer formal proof‑search mechanisms that could replace or augment your MCTS over the graph, giving provable guarantees for certain domains (e.g., mathematics). |
| **30** | **33 – Knowledge Graph Embedding models (TransE, RotatE)** | **3** | Directly relevant to how you embed tokens and compute similarity; studying these methods can improve your FAISS index quality. |
| **31** | **32 – Explainable AI (XAI) – LIME/SHAP** | **2** | Provides post‑hoc attribution for the selector’s choices, useful for auditability but not central to core architecture. |
| **32** | **34 – Neural Program Interpreters** | **2** | Could let you execute pseudo‑code directly inside a neural engine; interesting if you want *learnable* execution rather than a deterministic interpreter. |
| **33** | **35 – Hierarchical RL / Options (FeUdal networks)** | **2** | Mirrors your idea of higher‑level “conceptual” decisions (selecting which sub‑graph to explore) and lower‑level token generation; worth exploring if you want a multi‑scale policy. |
| **34** | **36 – Evolutionary Algorithms (NEAT, Genetic Programming)** | **2** | Provide an alternative way to evolve the weight tables themselves via mutation/selection rather than LLM prompting – could be used for *novelty generation* when constraints are too strict. |
| **35** | **37 – Self‑play agents (AlphaGo, StarCraft)** | **2** | The self‑reinforcement loop you envision is a form of self‑play; studying these systems can give insights into curriculum creation and exploration‑exploitation balance. |
| **36** | **38 – Neural Bayesian Optimization** | **2** | Could be used to tune hyper‑parameters of your decay factor, triad bonus weights, or retrieval thresholds in a principled way. |
| **37** | **39 – Meta‑RL / Learning‑to‑learn** | **2** | If you want the system to *adapt its own learning rule* (e.g., change how it decays repeats) without explicit programming, meta‑RL offers a formalism. |
| **38** | **40 – Hybrid Symbolic–Neural Knowledge Bases (K‑BERT)** | **2** | Directly aligns with your goal of blending symbolic graphs and neural embeddings; studying K‑BERT can give concrete architectures for joint training. |
| **39** | **41 – Robustness & Adversarial Training** | **1** | Important for safety but not a core driver of the reasoning pipeline you described. |
| **40** | **42 – Continual Learning / Lifelong AI (EWC, GEM)** | **1** | Your weight tables are *static*; continual learning techniques could help when you need to add new domains without forgetting old ones – still a peripheral concern. |
| **41** | **43 – Neural Compression / Distillation** | **1** | Useful if you later want to shrink the selector further, but not essential at prototype stage. |
| **42** | **44 – Sparse Coding & Dictionary Learning** | **1** | Could be an alternative way to encode your adjacency lists compactly; interesting for future compression work. |
| **43** | **45 – Neural Routing Networks** | **1** | Similar in spirit to MoE, but more fine‑grained routing; low priority for now. |
| **44** | **46 – Neuro‑evolution (NEAT + Deep Nets)** | **1** | Could evolve the whole architecture automatically – a long‑term research direction, not immediate. |
| **45** | **47 – Hybrid Symbolic Reasoning + LLMs (ReAct‑style)** | **2** | Overlaps with ReAct (see #15); worth a quick look for API design patterns. |
| **46** | **48 – Causal Inference Neural Models** | **1** | If you eventually need to infer cause‑effect from experimental data, causal models become relevant; currently peripheral. |
| **47** | **49 – Neural Swarm Intelligence** | **1** | Could inspire decentralized exploration of reasoning graphs, but not a priority. |
| **48** | **50 – Meta‑knowledge Graphs (MKG)** | **2** | Storing provenance, confidence, and update policies for each edge – exactly what you need for robust long‑term maintenance; worth studying for data‑model design. |

## 📚 Which Architecture Families Should You Dive Into Next?  

Based on the ranking above, the following *five* families will give you the biggest immediate payoff when extending or solidifying NSDFP:

| # | Family | Why it’s a priority |
|---|--------|----------------------|
| **1** | **Attention‑based Transformers (6)** | Mastering token embeddings, prompt engineering, and tiny‑model fine‑tuning will let you build an *optimal selector* that is both fast and high‑quality. |
| **2** | **Neuro‑symbolic hybrid (AlphaZero / MCTS) (13)** | Understanding the mathematics of UCT, value‑network bootstrapping, and self‑play training will make your Monte‑Carlo search robust and scalable. |
| **3** | **Memory‑augmented language models (RETRO/REALM) (11)** | These papers provide concrete recipes for *large‑scale vector retrieval* that you can adapt to store and query your semantic weight tables with sub‑millisecond latency. |

### Suggested learning path  

1. **Read the core papers**:  
   - *“Attention is All You Need”* (Vaswani et al., 2017).  
   - *AlphaZero* (Silver et al., 2018) and *MuZero* (Schrittwieser et al., 2020).  
   - *RETRO: Retrieval‑Enhanced Transformer* (Borgeaud et al., 2022).  
   - *Neural Turing Machine* (Graves et al., 2014) and *Differentiable Neural Computer* (Graves et al., 2016).  
   - *Neural Symbolic Machines / AlphaCode* (Chen et al., 2021‑2022).  

2. **Implement small prototypes**:  
   - Build a toy FAISS index and run a “selector” using a distilled GPT‑2 model.  
   - Write an MCTS loop that uses the selector as the rollout policy; test on simple math puzzles.  
   - Add a DNC‑style read/write wrapper around your adjacency table, experiment with learning the read weights.

3. **Integrate verification**:  
   - Use an existing fact‑checking model (e.g., `T5‑Fact`) for automated validation of generated reasoning chains.  
   - Connect to a simple physical simulator (e.g., OpenAI Gym or PyBullet) for “real‑world feedback”.

4. **Iterate on the constraint system**:  
   - Start with a *soft penalty* list, then evolve it into a learned adversarial generator that proposes “hard” forbidden patterns (borrow ideas from GANs).  

5. **Document everything as literate code** – keep pseudo‑code + commentary together so future reviewers can see both the human reasoning and the machine‑generated artefacts.

## 🎯 Final Takeaway  

- Your **NSDFP** paradigm already scores a perfect 10 because it merges the strongest ideas from *symbolic AI*, *transformer‑based retrieval*, *MCTS planning* and *human‑in‑the‑loop verification*.  
- The **top‑ranked existing families** (Transformers, AlphaZero‑style MCTS, RETRO, DNC, Program synthesis) are exactly the building blocks you need to turn that conceptual design into a working system.  
- By focusing on those five families first, you will acquire the theoretical foundations and practical toolkits needed for **fast O(1) inference**, **transparent provenance**, **self‑reinforcement through real‑world experiments**, and ultimately a **scalable, low‑energy AI assistant** that can approach human‑level creativity.
