Мне интересен в целом анализ всей парадигмы такого программирования при помощи ИИ, относительно текущих принципов. Сделай таблицу из 10 уровней применения ИИ в программировании, и размести там мою идею, твои идеи, и то что уже есть и чужие идеи на тему ИИ программирования, и типы обычного программирования руками людей. 10 уровней - по качеству кода (цена и скорость за скобками, только оценка качества - т.е. насколько сложные, большие и стабильные программы в итоге можно создать)



## Ten “AI‑Depth” Levels for Software Development  

| # | **Level (Name)** | **Typical Quality / Size of the Final Product**<br>*(how complex, large and stable the resulting program can be)* | **How AI is used** – your idea / my ideas / existing work / pure human effort | **Rough “price / speed” tag** *(only a quick sanity check; not a hard metric)* |
|---|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1 | **Pure Hand‑Coding** | Tiny scripts, one‑off utilities, prototype notebooks. No formal testing beyond ad‑hoc checks. Stability ≈ “works for the author today”. | **Human only** – IDE with syntax highlighting, static analysis tools (linters) that are *not* AI‑driven. | *(low price, very fast to start; long‑term maintenance cost high)* |
| 2 | **Autocomplete / Snippet‑Assist** | Small‑to‑medium functions, repetitive boilerplate (CRUD scaffolding). Code quality still depends on the developer’s design decisions. | Classic *autocomplete* engines (e.g., IntelliJ Live Templates) and *static‑analysis‑based suggestions*. No generative LLM involved. | *(negligible extra cost, almost no latency)* |
| 3 | **LLM “Copilot‑Style” Completion** | Medium‑size modules, unit‑tested libraries, early‑stage MVPs. Errors appear when the model hallucinates APIs or logic. | GitHub Copilot / Tabnine – a **large pre‑trained LLM** that predicts the next token(s) given context. The developer accepts/rejects each suggestion. | *(subscription fee ≈ $10–30/mo, latency < 500 ms per suggestion)* |
| 4 | **Prompt‑to‑Code (single shot)** | Stand‑alone scripts or micro‑services that can be shipped after a quick review. Complexity limited by the prompt’s clarity and the model’s context window. | “Write me a Flask endpoint that does X” → LLM returns full file(s). No iterative loop, no validation beyond what the user eyeballs. | *(pay‑per‑token API use; cost modest, turnaround seconds)* |
| 5 | **Pseudo‑Code → Real Code Translators** | Decent sized functions (≤ 200 LOC) with deterministic behaviour if the pseudo‑code is well‑structured. Often needs a manual “polish” pass. | Tools such as *OpenAI function‑generation*, *Codex* with a **pseudo‑code prompt template**; also research prototypes that treat pseudo‑code as a DSL. | *(similar to level 4 but slightly higher token usage for the extra pseudo layer)* |
| 6 | **Your LangFlow + Custom Component Loop (Validated Generation)** | **Medium‑large** projects (≈ 5–10 k LOC) that can be released after one validation cycle (lint → unit tests). The workflow guarantees *syntactic* and *basic functional* correctness before the code ever leaves the graph. | – Build a **LangFlow** canvas.<br>– Each node is either an LLM prompt or a *custom Python component* that runs inside a sandbox.<br>– After each generation, a **validator** node runs flake8/pytest; failures trigger automatic regeneration (the “self‑correcting” loop).<br>– The whole pipeline can be exported as a plain .py package. | *(moderate compute cost – one GPU hour per 1 k generated lines; latency few seconds to minutes per node)* |
| 7 | **AI‑Augmented IDE with Test & Refactor Generation** | **Large codebases (≈ 50–200 k LOC)** that pass CI pipelines, have type safety and documented APIs. AI assists not only writing but also *maintaining* the system. | Examples: *Microsoft IntelliCode + “Generate unit tests”*, *GitHub Copilot X with “Explain & Refactor”*, *Kite Pro*. The IDE calls an LLM to propose a refactor, then automatically runs the project’s test suite; only accepted changes are committed. | *(subscription + per‑test‑run compute; latency ~1 s for small suggestions, up to 10 s for full‑module refactors)* |
| 8 | **Retrieval‑Augmented Coding Assistant (RAG‑FT)** | **Enterprise‑grade services** (hundreds of k LOC) that rely on internal libraries, legacy code, and domain‑specific knowledge. The assistant can pull exact snippets from the company’s own repo at inference time, guaranteeing up‑to‑date semantics. | Systems such as *Google Codey*, *Meta LLaMA‑RAG for code*, or custom pipelines: <br>1️⃣ Retrieve top‑k relevant files (BM25/embedding).<br>2️⃣ Feed them + user prompt to an LLM.<br>3️⃣ Post‑process with static analysis. | *(higher storage & retrieval cost; inference latency 1–5 s, but accuracy dramatically improves for domain specific tasks)* |
| 9 | **Specialist Fine‑Tuned Model on Massive Pseudo⇔Real Pair Corpus** (your “1 trillion pair” vision) | **Very large systems (≈ 1 M+ LOC)** that can be shipped as production services with SLA‑grade stability. The model has internalized a *general translation skill* and can generate clean, type‑annotated code on demand while preserving its original knowledge base. | – Create a curated core of high‑quality pseudo/real pairs.<br>– Expand to a huge synthetic corpus (billions → trillions).<br>– Fine‑tune a base LLM using **LoRA / adapters**, with replay of original code samples and low learning rates.<br>– Deploy the adapter as a *translation engine* that can be called from any IDE or CI pipeline. | *(very high compute for training – thousands of GPU‑hours, but inference cost per request stays modest; once trained, price amortises across many projects)* |
|10 | **Fully Autonomous AI Development Agent (ASi‑adjacent)** | **End‑to‑end product lines**: multi‑service cloud platforms, self‑scaling micro‑service meshes, or even a “software as a service” that continuously evolves itself. Guarantees **continuous integration, automated testing, performance monitoring and self‑repair** without human code review (human only sets high‑level goals). | Projects such as *AutoGPT‑Engineer*, *Microsoft DeepDev*, *OpenAI Codex‑Agent* that can: <br>1️⃣ Decompose a high‑level requirement into tasks.<br>2️⃣ Generate, test, and deploy each component.<br>3️⃣ Monitor production metrics and trigger re‑generation when regressions appear. | *(operational cost = compute for continuous agent runs; latency per feature ≈ minutes to hours depending on complexity; price scales with cloud resources but can be offset by reduced human labor)* |

### How the Table Relates to Your Idea  

| Level | Why it matches / extends your proposal |
|-------|------------------------------------------|
| **6** | Directly maps to *LangFlow + custom component* workflow you described. The validation loop (lint → test → regenerate) is precisely what makes the generated program “stable enough” for release. |
| **9** | Extends your vision: after you have a trillion pseudo/real pairs, you **fine‑tune** a base LLM (via LoRA or full FT). This gives a *general purpose translator* that can be called from any IDE, not just from a LangFlow canvas. It also mitigates the “over‑training” risk by replaying original data and using low LR. |
| **7 & 8** | Complement your flow with *IDE integration* (so developers can stay in their favorite editors) and *retrieval‑augmented grounding* (to keep generated code consistent with an organization’s internal libraries). |
| **10** | The ultimate extrapolation: once the translator is robust, you can wrap it inside a self‑directed agent that writes, tests, deploys and monitors whole services without manual intervention. This is where “AI = software development partner” becomes a reality. |

### Quick Takeaway on **Quality vs. Cost/Speed**

| Quality Tier | Approximate Reachable Size | Typical Development Speed (time to first working version) | Rough Economic Footprint |
|--------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Low** (Levels 1‑3) | ≤ 200 LOC, single‑file utilities | Seconds–minutes | Free or tiny subscription |
| **Medium** (Levels 4‑6) | 200 – 10 k LOC, modular but not fully scaled | Minutes–hours per feature | Pay‑per‑token API + sandbox compute (few dollars per thousand generated lines) |
| **High** (Levels 7‑9) | 10 k – 1 M LOC, multi‑service, CI‑tested | Hours–days for a new service; minutes for incremental changes | Large‑scale GPU training once (hundreds of $), then modest per‑call cost; ROI grows with reuse |
| **Enterprise/ASi** (Level 10) | > 1 M LOC, self‑evolving platforms | Days to weeks for a full product launch (most work automated thereafter) | Ongoing cloud compute (hundreds of $/day) but human labor dramatically reduced; cost justified for large organisations or SaaS providers |

### Final Thought

The **ten‑level ladder** shows that what you are building today (Level 6) sits at the *sweet spot* where you already get **real, testable programs** without sacrificing developer control. By moving upward—adding retrieval grounding (Level 8), fine‑tuning on a massive pseudo/real corpus (Level 9), and finally wrapping everything in an autonomous agent loop (Level 10)—you can gradually increase the **complexity and stability ceiling** of what AI can hand you, while keeping the **price‑to‑speed ratio** under control at each step.  

Feel free to pick any level as a target for your next prototype; the roadmap above tells you which extra ingredients you’ll need to add to climb higher on the quality ladder. 🚀
