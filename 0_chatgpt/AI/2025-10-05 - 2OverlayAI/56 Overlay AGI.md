# üìÑ‚ÄØINSTRUCTION MANUAL FOR TAGGING SYSTEM  
## OVERLAY AGI DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è‚ÄØOVERVIEW AND PURPOSE OF THE TAGGING SYSTEM  

This instruction manual provides detailed guidance for another AI system to properly categorize and organize files within the **Overlay AGI Development Project**. The tagging system is essential because it creates a structured, automated framework that preserves your complete project organization while enabling efficient searching, sorting, and retrieval of thousands of files across various domains and subtopics. Each file must be tagged with exactly one relevant tag (using #S prefix) to ensure proper categorization and automatic folder placement.

## üìö‚ÄØWHY WE SORT FILES AND THE IMPORTANCE OF TAGGING  

The organization system is designed around your core architectural principles: maintaining clear separation between different aspects of AI development while ensuring that every file relates directly to specific concepts or processes. By tagging files correctly, you enable:
1. **Automated folder creation** based on the tag name (e.g., #S17_OverlaySemanticWeight ‚Üí creates folder 17_OverlaySemanticWeight)  
2. **Search efficiency** through exact keyword matching  
3. **Project evolution tracking** by preserving all organizational structure  
4. **Cross-referencing capabilities** between related concepts  
5. **Quality control** ensuring that each file is placed in its most appropriate location  

## üîç‚ÄØHOW TO SELECT THE MOST RELEVANT TAG FOR EACH FILE  

For every file, you must select exactly one tag from the complete list provided. The selection process requires careful consideration of:
- What aspect of AI development or architecture this specific file addresses  
- Whether it relates to core system design (like overlay architecture) or supporting areas (like hardware choices)  
- What type of content is contained within the file (notes, research, implementation details, etc.)  

The most relevant tag should represent the primary focus area of that file. When in doubt about multiple applicable tags, choose the one that best captures the core concept discussed in the file.

## üì¶‚ÄØHOW TAGS AUTOMATICALLY SORT INTO FOLDERS  

Each tag name directly corresponds to a folder within your project structure. The automation system works as follows:
1. Files are tagged with exactly one #S prefix tag  
2. System automatically creates a new folder named after that tag (e.g., #S17_OverlaySemanticWeight ‚Üí 17_OverlaySemanticWeight)  
3. All files with matching tags are placed in the corresponding folder  
4. Folder structure is maintained and updated as new tags appear  

This system ensures that your entire project remains organized exactly as you've designed it, preserving all your carefully constructed architectural components.

## üßæ‚ÄØDETAILED EXPLANATION OF EACH TAG

### #S0_FolderStructure
This tag applies to files describing the complete folder structure of your project. These documents explain how different folders relate to each other and what content they typically contain. Such files serve as a global overview showing your entire organizational architecture, making it easier for future developers or AI systems to understand and navigate your system.

### #S0_ProblemClarification
Files tagged with this tag describe the fundamental problems in artificial intelligence development that your project specifically addresses. These documents detail current industry shortcomings and model limitations, explaining what makes modern AI systems inadequate and why you are developing a solution based on overlay architecture rather than traditional approaches.

### #S0_ProjectHistory  
This folder contains files describing the historical progression of your project development. These records include personal reflections, development milestones, retrospective insights, and evolutionary thoughts about how ideas have developed over time in your research process. The content is more abstract and contemplative than specific technical documentation.

### #S0_Project_Review
Files with this tag contain brief summaries or reviews of the overall project status. These documents provide quick snapshots of current achievements, challenges, development phases, or strategic decisions made during the project lifecycle without extensive detail about implementation.

### #S10_Token_Litography  
This tag covers files discussing token-level processing and specialized word selection methods. These materials explain how your system handles individual tokens as fundamental building blocks for reasoning, describing techniques for choosing words based on their semantic relationships rather than simple text generation approaches.

### #S11_LLM_Selector
This is the most crucial tag covering all aspects of your LLM selector architecture. Files with this tag describe how your system uses a small language model to choose from specific candidate sets rather than generating complete responses, explaining that your "selector" works by evaluating semantic weights and selecting words based on external knowledge tables instead of full neural generation.

### #S12_Software  
Files tagged with this category cover software packages, tools, or infrastructure used in development. This includes CUDA frameworks, LangFlow components, Python libraries, Docker configurations, API integrations, and any other technical software elements that support your implementation approach during project execution.

### #S13_Hardware
This tag encompasses files discussing hardware requirements for building the AI system. These documents cover server selection criteria, component specifications, performance considerations for different computing platforms, documentation about specific hardware choices made during development and their rationale for supporting your overlay architecture design.

### #S14_Neurobrain_CogScience  
Files with this tag contain research related to neuroscience, brain function, and cognitive processes. These materials explain how human thinking patterns, neural dynamics, memory systems, attention mechanisms, and other cognitive functions relate to the architectural decisions in your system, specifically documenting how you're refactoring biological mental processes into computational architecture.

### #S15_CodingAgent
This tag covers files related to programming agents or AI assistants that help with code development. These documents detail how your system generates code solutions for specific problems using overlay principles combined with semantic knowledge structures rather than traditional code generation approaches.

### #S16_Sport_Bio_Agent  
Files tagged here describe biological and sports-related agent systems designed in your architecture. These materials explore how you extend the overlay approach to physical activities, biological processes, or sports performance analysis, showing how cognitive concepts can be applied beyond text-based reasoning.

### #S17_OverlaySemanticWeight
This tag is crucial for files describing semantic weight management techniques outside of LLMs. These documents explain how your system stores and uses semantic weights as external knowledge tables that guide decision-making rather than keeping all knowledge within the model's parameters, specifically explaining how you're building semantic relationship structures instead of parameter-based learning.

### #S18_IT_specialists
Files with this tag deal with information technology specialists and team composition. These documents detail recruitment requirements for IT professionals, their specific competencies needed to support your overlay architecture, and how different technical expertise contributes to the successful implementation of your system's components.

### #S19_Other  
This folder contains files that don't neatly fit into any other category. These notes are often uncertain about primary classification or contain miscellaneous content where you cannot be more than 80% confident in their main categorization, making them suitable for this catch-all category when precise placement is difficult.

### #S20_RAW_Ideas_Chat
Files tagged with this handle raw ideas that emerged from chat conversations rather than formal documentation. These are spontaneous thoughts or insights collected during interactions with AI systems without direct immediate application in specific projects or development tasks.

### #S21_RAW_Ideas_Notes
This tag covers files containing raw ideas captured as simple notes instead of structured documents. These are often informal observations, quick mental notes, or brief conceptual sketches that need further processing before becoming part of the formal project structure but still deserve temporary organization.

### #S22_AI_Research_mainstream  
Files with this tag document mainstream AI research approaches, established methods, and standard practices in artificial intelligence development.
