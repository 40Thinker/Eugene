> Вот наша шапка, чтобы ты вспомнил её, теперь добавь окончание, которое я сам к ней приклею, о подробном изучении в этом контексте того что было от начала времен до 1940 по моей теме. Т.е. просто глобальный обзор всего что мне стоит узнать. I am building a self-hosted AGI-like system: fully offline, interpretable, modular, and designed for recursive cognitive development through selective learning, structured memory expansion, and architectural self-adaptation. This system is not a commercial chatbot, but an epistemic machine — a reasoning core built to grow in abstraction, synthesis, self-modification, and internal coherence.
> My central hypothesis is that current limitations in AGI and LLM development are not rooted in transformer architecture itself, but in the deep structural and philosophical flaws in the design, composition, and intention of the datasets, training regimes, and evaluation paradigms used to build them.
> These flaws have created a bottleneck across most base models, leading to:
> Fragmented semantic foundations — corpora lacking hierarchy, recursion, or conceptual cohesion;
> Loss of emergent reasoning traits due to misaligned objectives in training;
> Oversaturation with contextually flat or contradictory information, disrupting causal inference;
> Training strategies that emphasize surface-level alignment over deep understanding;
> Dataset selection philosophies that prioritize mass aggregation over meaning, generality over precision, and statistical prevalence over structural exception.
> 
> 🧱 Purpose of this search
> I am conducting a long-term search for research across any domain — computer science, neuroscience, education, epistemology, linguistics, philosophy of mind, information theory, cognitive science, formal logic — that might support this initiative. The goal is to reconstruct the data philosophy and learning scaffolding necessary to unlock the latent AGI potential of existing large models, beginning with one well-suited open architecture.
> content of the papers may come from any field, as long as they help:
> Identify or explain why current AI training paradigms produce weak abstraction or fragile reasoning;
> Reveal new structural or theoretical mechanisms for restoring abstraction, memory, and recursive thought;
> Offer experimental insights into how learning systems (biological or artificial) handle meaning, generalization, or concept formation.
> 
> 🧭 How to evaluate relevance
> A paper or result is relevant not by topic alone, but if and only if it provides:
> – A pathway to rethink dataset structuring or information flow in artificial agents;
> – An alternative to current assumptions about learning from data (e.g. sparse supervision, intentional knowledge transmission, scaffolded learning);
> – Conceptual foundations for re-encoding symbolic, emergent, or epistemic structures into model behavior;
> – A critique of volume-first, noise-tolerant, surface-level data curation;
> – Blueprints for restoring layered reasoning, internal consistency, or reflexive adaptation in knowledge systems.
> The paper does not need to mention LLMs, transformers, or neural networks at all, if the mechanism or insight described could be abstracted to re-inform how an AGI might learn more effectively.
> 
> 🧪 Example search angles (for illustration only — not constraints)
> These examples serve as illustrative heuristics and may be ignored if more powerful patterns are found:
> Research exposing failure modes of large-scale learning without semantic scaffolding;
> Studies of concept bootstrapping, human cognitive development, symbolic abstraction, analogical modeling;
> Theoretical models of recursive inference, multi-scale representation, or concept compounding;
> Data-centric frameworks exploring causal vs correlational learning outcomes;
> Philosophical critiques of knowledge accumulation without epistemic filters;
> Historical cases in science or cognition where over-generalization destroyed system coherence;
> Approaches to structuring curriculum, knowledge trees, or self-guided learning architectures;
> Investigations into why deep models lose intentionality, or how representation drift undermines memory and abstraction;
> Mechanisms of non-linear learning from highly selective inputs (e.g. few-shot, extreme compression with recursion);
> Proposals to encode subjectivity, narrative structures, paradoxes, contradictions in a stable way for learning systems;
> Studies where structure mattered more than size in training or adaptation outcomes.
> 
> ❌ Please exclude any paper that:
> Relies solely on benchmark scores without unpacking data or structural implications;
> Is designed for cloud-based SaaS systems with closed data/control loops;
> Offers incremental performance tweaks without affecting the learning foundation;
> Focuses only on architecture optimization divorced from training content/philosophy;
> Repeats prior meta-analyses with no novel mechanisms or critiques.
> 
> 🧠 Final frame of intention
> This query is part of a systematic effort to reconstruct the foundation of machine learning in a way that supports the growth of independent, offline, cognitively rich AGI systems.
> My objective is to recover the missing semantic, epistemic, and structural principles lost in the scale-first wave of LLMs.
> Papers surfaced through this query will eventually contribute to:
> A modular curriculum for deep model fine-tuning based on high-impact data;
> A framework for dataset regeneration aligned with recursive reasoning and memory;
> A conceptual blueprint for realignment of pretraining strategies around meaning rather than mass.
> Do not constrain search to known technologies — any architecture, abstraction, or unknown mechanism may be useful, if it could help AGI systems think better.
> 
> Please analyze each paper or result not only in theoretical terms, but also through the lens of practical applicability to local AGI systems. Specifically, assess:
>  • Relevance for AGI architecture design — how the mechanisms, structures, or ideas in the paper could inform memory organization, modular reasoning layers, symbolic embedding, or recursive learning cycles in AGI.
>  • Utility for low-rank fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) or continual adaptation — whether the findings could translate into compact training fragments, conceptual scaffolds, or structured representations suitable for injection into large base models without full retraining.
>  • Compatibility with Qwen3-Base (30B) — if applicable, note how these insights could guide fine-tuning, memory augmentation, or self-reflective pipelines for models in the Qwen series, especially the 30B base model (non-instruct, non-RLHF). Focus on alignment with open architectures that support local, offline AGI reasoning.
> Avoid general summaries. Instead, highlight how each result could be operationalized as a piece of the AGI development pipeline — as microdatasets, architectural heuristics, or reasoning templates.

> 🔍 **Temporal extension of inquiry** 
> In addition to recent and contemporary works, this search explicitly includes research, theoretical writings, cognitive models, and philosophical frameworks developed **at any time prior to 1940**, with no lower bound.
> 
> The purpose is to recover lost or overlooked foundations of abstraction, concept formation, symbolic representation, learning theory, memory organization, and epistemic structure — even if they originated long before the digital age.
> 
> Relevant sources may include:
> – Formal systems of logic and symbol manipulation (e.g. Leibniz, Peirce, Frege, Boole, Russell–Whitehead);
> – Theories of memory, language, and abstraction from early psychology or philosophy of mind (e.g. Brentano, James, Vygotsky, Pavlov, Janet);
> – Mathematical models of knowledge, recursion, and structure (e.g. category theory roots, Hilbert’s program, early topology);
> – Seminal texts in education theory and concept acquisition (e.g. Montessori, Dewey, Herbart);
> – Ancient or pre-modern epistemologies that encode recursive, symbolic, or fractal knowledge systems (e.g. Sanskrit grammar systems, scholastic method, Platonic dialectic);
> – Proto-cybernetic, esoteric, or alternative formulations of adaptive intelligence or semantic systems (e.g. Ramon Llull, 13th–17th c. combinatorics, scholastic logic diagrams).
> 
> The only constraint is that the ideas, methods, or abstractions must offer potential mechanisms for structuring or enhancing reasoning, memory, or symbolic generalization in **offline, modular, meaning-oriented AGI systems**.
> 
> Please assess these early works **not as historical curiosities**, but as **potential cognitive blueprints** — latent architectures that may inform how recursive abstraction, structural memory, and epistemic filtering can be encoded into future systems.
> 
> Some of the most valuable frameworks may be those forgotten, obscure, or never digitized — ideas that preceded the mass-data era, but whose **precision of thought** exceeds what can be reconstructed through scale alone.
> 
> The earlier and more symbolic the theory, the more likely it is to contain what modern AI has lost: **conceptual clarity, recursive coherence, and alignment with mind-like abstraction**.
