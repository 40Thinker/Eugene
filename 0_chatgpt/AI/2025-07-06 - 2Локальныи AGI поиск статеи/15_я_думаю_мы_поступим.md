> Я думаю мы поступим так. Ты модифицируешь этот запрос так, что сделаешь еще еще больше и подробнее, но уберешь всю конкретику вроде RAG, токенов, конкретных запросов. Я буду это подставлять по 1 за раз, чтобы перплексити мог искать по ультраузкой темы за все время. А кол-во тем - 200-1000, и мы это сделаем потом отдельно. И каждая будет подробно разжевана. Пока что переделай в универсальную шапку на 2-3 А4 листа этот запрос:
> 
> > I am building a self-hosted AGI-like system — fully offline, modular, and evolving through recursive fine-tuning, distillation, and memory-aware extensions (e.g. LoRA, RAG, local adapters). My current hypothesis is that the **stagnation of the LLM/AGI field is not due to transformer limitations**, but due to a **fundamentally flawed foundation in dataset design, fine-tuning pipelines, pretraining philosophies, and evaluation regimes**.
> >
> > Many base models — including excellent architectures like Qwen 3–30B — are underperforming at high-level reasoning not because they lack capacity, but because:
> >
> > 1. **Their base pretraining datasets are philosophically, semantically and structurally incoherent**;
> > 2. They are missing latent structures and high-level abstractions needed for cognitive recursion;
> > 3. Post-training strategies (fine-tuning, RLHF, chat templates) suppress emergent behaviors;
> > 4. The prevailing philosophy of dataset curation emphasizes **volume over depth**, **breadth over causal hierarchy**, and **average truth over meaningful exception**.
> >
> > Therefore, I’m initiating a 3-phase strategy:
> >
> > * Phase 1: Search for any research since **Jan 1–7, 2015**, across all disciplines, that could help **(a)** identify these structural and philosophical failures in current datasets or training paradigms, or **(b)** offer mechanics to rebuild them with greater AGI-alignment;
> > * Phase 2: Extract all mechanics, concepts, workflows, or structures that could be used to **fine-tune Qwen3-30B-base** into a recursive, local AGI with deep understanding;
> > * Phase 3: Design micro-datasets, curriculum fragments, and memory injection strategies for LoRA, RAG, or modular distillation pipelines.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 🔍 The search goal is not bounded by NLP or transformer research.
> 
> > Any paper from **January 1 to January 7, 2015**, across AI, neuroscience, learning theory, philosophy, data science, cognitive systems, complex systems, linguistics or software engineering may be relevant **only if it helps us understand**:
> >
> > * How flawed data curation leads to degenerate cognition in large models;
> > * How the **structure of a dataset can encode or destroy reasoning capacity**;
> > * What types of input/representation are more effective at enabling **recursive self-improvement**;
> > * How **semantic loss or “meaning decay”** occurs during tokenization, compression, and training.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 🔬 Useful example areas (search directions, not rules)
> 
> ### 1. **Failures in dataset philosophy**
> 
> * Critiques of LLM-scale datasets (e.g. Common Crawl, The Pile) showing **semantic redundancy, incoherence, or anti-cognition bias**;
> * Historical papers that discuss the **collapse of reasoning** due to **averaging over contradiction** (e.g. when factual ambiguity is treated as noise instead of structure);
> * Data-centric AI research exposing the problems of scale-first curation and statistical "truthiness".
> 
> ### 2. **Better ways to construct or select data**
> 
> * Studies proposing **curriculum learning with concept dependency graphs**;
> * Papers on **synthetic datasets that encode mathematical or philosophical rigor**;
> * Epistemology-aware dataset filtering (e.g., remove text without causal or deductive flow);
> * Psycholinguistic models that discuss how **children learn concepts from sparse data** and how this could translate into machine data selection.
> 
> ### 3. **Latent structure vs token flatness**
> 
> * JEPA-like models where tokens are replaced by latent predictors;
> * Emergent behavior from **non-tokenized input**: concept vectors, high-level anchor points, symbolic-analog hybrids;
> * Representational geometry studies of latent spaces — what shapes allow for reasoning recursion.
> 
> ### 4. **Microdataset effects**
> 
> * Case studies where **small datasets** had **disproportionate impact** on model performance (especially low-rank finetuning);
> * Papers showing **LoRA or QLoRA success** with datasets of 10–1000 examples that were well-structured;
> * “Exemplar learning” or “seed concept bootstrapping” (train from a few high-quality nuclei instead of broad corpora).
> 
> ### 5. **Memory and RAG-based reassembly**
> 
> * Hybrid RAG systems where a live index is built from **structured reasoning fragments**, not full documents;
> * Memory augmentation via **filtered graph snippets**, **dialogue state loops**, or **contextual self-retrieval**;
> * Novel post-RAG architectures that build **recursive context trees** instead of flat retrieval.
> 
> ### 6. **Emergence failures due to data noise**
> 
> * Why LLMs lose recursion or reflection at scale — is it due to noise, entropy, redundancy?
> * When does training on too much internet garbage flatten model gradients and saturate attention?
> * Is there a quantifiable threshold at which **emergent traits decay with overfitting to poor data**?
> 
> ### 7. **Encoding subjective / symbolic / recursive structures**
> 
> * Research that encodes **subjectivity, narrative logic, mythic structure, or nested abstraction** into training corpora;
> * Papers that explain how **symbolic cognition can be injected** into neural networks via training selection;
> * Multi-modal or cross-modal pipelines that use **sketches, visual flows, math diagrams** to augment language grounding.

> ## ✅ The paper is only relevant if…
> 
> > It has **potential to help build or fine-tune a local AGI**, particularly via improving datasets, training principles, or reasoning interfaces. The subject matter does not have to mention transformers or LLMs — it is relevant if it can **indirectly support** the following outcome:
> 
> **“Making Qwen3-30B-Base smarter by giving it the right data, in the right shape, with the right structure.”**
> 
> ---
> 
> ## ❌ Please exclude:
> 
> * Any SaaS- or API-based closed system papers;
> * Superficial benchmark competition results with no insight into dataset mechanics;
> * Pure statistical modeling papers with no relevance to AGI reasoning;
> * Review articles that repeat high-level points without exposing structural innovation.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 🧩 Final objective
> 
> I’m reconstructing the philosophical, linguistic, and data-theoretical basis of local AGI training. This prompt is meant to **extract latent blueprints** from any field, as long as the paper (from Jan 1–7, 2015) could help:
> 
> * Explain *why current LLMs fail to think*;
> * Show *how dataset structure impacts recursion and emergence*;
> * Contribute to *methods of rescuing base models like Qwen3-30B* via fine-tuned microlearning or RAG-driven scaffolding.
> 
> Please prioritize insight, structure, and cross-domain bridges over surface-level results. The goal is **to find tools that fix the AGI pipeline at its roots**.

> Вот универсализированная и расширенная версия твоего запроса ― без конкретных технологий (таких как RAG, LoRA, токены), но с сохранением **глубинной философии поиска** и с учётом того, что ты будешь подставлять **узкие темы отдельно**, одну за другой. Этот текст предназначен как **шаблон-заголовок (шапка)**, к которому можно добавлять любые микротемы — и всё вместе будет укладываться в ~2.5–3 А4.

> > I am building a self-hosted AGI-like system: fully offline, interpretable, modular, and designed for recursive cognitive development through selective learning, structured memory expansion, and architectural self-adaptation. This system is not a commercial chatbot, but an epistemic machine — a reasoning core built to grow in abstraction, synthesis, self-modification, and internal coherence.
> >
> > My central hypothesis is that **current limitations in AGI and LLM development are not rooted in transformer architecture itself**, but in the **deep structural and philosophical flaws in the design, composition, and intention of the datasets, training regimes, and evaluation paradigms** used to build them.

> > 1. **Fragmented semantic foundations** — corpora lacking hierarchy, recursion, or conceptual cohesion;
> > 2. **Loss of emergent reasoning traits** due to misaligned objectives in training;

The goal is to **reconstruct the data philosophy and learning scaffolding necessary to unlock the latent AGI potential of existing large models**, beginning with one well-suited open architecture.

> >
> > – A pathway to rethink dataset structuring or information flow in artificial agents;

> > – Conceptual foundations for re-encoding symbolic, emergent, or epistemic structures into model behavior; 
> > – A critique of volume-first, noise-tolerant, surface-level data curation;
> > – Blueprints for restoring layered reasoning, internal consistency, or reflexive adaptation in knowledge systems.

> 
> - A modular curriculum for deep model fine-tuning based on high-impact data;
> - A framework for dataset regeneration aligned with recursive reasoning and memory;
