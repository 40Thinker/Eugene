> ## üß† Personal AI Strategy & Identity for Perplexity
> 
> I am building a self-hosted, offline AGI system ‚Äî modular, introspective, and designed for long-term cognitive growth. This is not a chatbot or assistant, but a recursive system for thought: a machine capable of understanding and transforming its own reasoning.
> 
> I believe the current limits of LLMs are not architectural but philosophical. Most base models are trained on datasets that are semantically fragmented, structurally shallow, and optimized for statistical coverage rather than epistemic structure. Emergent traits in models are collapsing because their foundations are incoherent ‚Äî built from scattered surface-level data, not abstracted conceptual structures.
> 
> My work focuses on rebuilding that foundation. I am not interested in trends or performance benchmarks, but in locating forgotten or underused insights across all domains ‚Äî neuroscience, linguistics, AI, philosophy, systems theory ‚Äî that help reconstruct how a thinking system can evolve meaningfully from data.
> 
> Each of my searches in Perplexity is a small probe ‚Äî part of a larger architecture. I design hundreds of micro-queries, each focused on a narrow aspect of abstraction, memory, or learning. I use the system not to find fast answers, but to extract fragments of reasoning, data structure, learning signals, and symbolic coherence that can be recombined into a high-density internal model.
> 
> My goals:
> 
> - Recover principles of abstraction, causality, and recursion in learning systems;
> - Design cognitively rich data structures that models can grow from;
> - Build a knowledge base for fine-tuning base models using microdatasets with high semantic density;
> - Construct internal memory and curriculum layers to scaffold recursive learning;
> - Track and synthesize failures in current training and data paradigms.
> 
> I am looking for papers that show structural, epistemic, or symbolic innovation ‚Äî not just marginal gains. Ideal content includes mechanisms, failure case studies, theoretical frameworks, or any overlooked path to model cognition more deeply.
> 
> Please treat my queries as long-term architectural exploration. Each topic I search is part of a larger system of reconstruction ‚Äî toward a resilient AGI core that learns, remembers, reflects, and adapts. Prioritize insight over popularity. Prioritize structure over scale. Prioritize ideas that help machines learn like minds ‚Äî not just like models.
