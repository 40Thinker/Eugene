> > 
> > ‚Äì Skeletal muscle hypertrophy 
> > ‚Äì Aerobic/mitochondrial endurance 
> > ‚Äì Erythropoiesis and red blood cell mass expansion 
> >
> > Please **search only for papers published on June 1, 2020** (or extremely close to it ‚Äî no more than a 1‚Äì2 day offset). This is not about compiling general literature ‚Äî I am looking for **unique, mechanistic, or correlative insights** that could uncover **non-obvious connections** and trigger **cross-domain hypotheses**.
> >
> > The list below contains **examples** of what might be useful ‚Äî these are not strict filters but **directions** that help select promising material. Anything that can help build **long causal chains**, identify **latent regulators**, or connect **indirect variables** is valuable. I aim to construct systems-level models similar to causal graphs or knowledge maps (e.g., interaction diagrams of stimuli, metabolites, gene expression, epigenetic modulation, and functional outcomes like strength or VO‚ÇÇmax).

> >
> > ‚Ä¢ Satellite cell response to different **training stimuli** ‚Äî e.g., resistance, endurance, sprint, BFR (blood flow restriction), fasting, hypoxia 
> > ‚Ä¢ Interactions between **stem cells and their niche**: macrophages, endothelial cells, fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), lymphatics 
> > ‚Ä¢ **Myonuclear domain plasticity** and its role in long-term hypertrophy ‚Äî to nuclear accretion, satellite cell fusion 
> > ‚Ä¢ Effect of **metabolic intermediates** (succinate, ROS, inosine, lactate, NAD‚Å∫, phosphocreatine) on stem cell fate decisions or epigenetics 
> > ‚Ä¢ Hypoxia-induced or training-induced **stress erythropoiesis** via BMP4, GATA1/2, STAT5, EPO-R, SCF‚Äìc-Kit axis 
> > ‚Ä¢ **Fasting, betaine, melatonin, creatine, high-altitude exposure** ‚Äî their influence on stem cell maintenance, mitochondrial activation, and DNA methylation 
> > ‚Ä¢ **Epigenetic remodeling** in response to physical activity: H3K27ac, DNA demethylation, histone variant switching in stem/progenitor cells 
> > ‚Ä¢ Mitochondrial fusion/fission, redox signaling, and mitophagy in **stem cell quality control** under training stress 
> > ‚Ä¢ Role of **supramolecular complexes**, such as poly(A) tail regulators or polysome lifespan, in SC-driven regeneration 
> > ‚Ä¢ Interaction between **ribosomal biogenesis**, satellite cell activity, and mTORC1/REDD1/AMPK balance 
> > ‚Ä¢ Longitudinal training-induced shifts in **transcriptional programs** of satellite or hematopoietic SCs (example: PAX7, MyoD, Myf5, HIF1Œ±, KLF1) 
> > ‚Ä¢ Rare mechanisms: e.g., ROS-triggered asymmetric division of SCs, titin kinase mechanosensing, or selective activation via extracellular ATP/adenosine 
> > ‚Ä¢ Regeneration‚Äë systemic factors: cytokines, myokines, circulating exosomes 
> > ‚Ä¢ Signaling redundancy and **compensatory circuits** ‚Äî how different stimuli (e.g., cold exposure vs hypoxia) can converge on shared stem cell behavior 
> >
> > Again, these are **search prompts**, not constraints. If a paper discusses **any novel, deep, or mechanistically interesting relationship** involving stem cells and sports-related physiological changes, include it.
> >
> > ### ‚ùå Please exclude:
> >
> > ‚Äì Review articles with no mechanistic depth 
> > ‚Äì Meta-analyses summarizing only statistical effect sizes 
> > ‚Äì Articles that only report gross outcomes (e.g., ‚ÄúVO‚ÇÇmax increased after X weeks of training‚Äù) without detailing pathways, cell-level effects, or causal intermediates 
> > ‚Äì Purely theoretical speculation with no experimental or molecular basis 
> >
> > ### ‚úÖ Include papers that offer:
> >
> > ‚Äì Molecular signaling cascades (e.g., Wnt, Notch, mTOR, FoxO, HIF) involved in stem cell activation under exercise conditions 
> > ‚Äì Causal/experimental interventions (e.g., knockouts, inhibitors, stress protocols) to SC behavior 
> > ‚Äì Descriptions of tissue-level consequences traceable to cell-level dynamics 
> > ‚Äì Evidence of **cross-regulation** between muscle and hematopoietic SCs 
> > ‚Äì Examples where **non-muscle variables** (gut, brain, fat, immune, circadian) influence stem cell behavior relevant to training 
> >
> > The final goal is to identify **chains of interaction** and points of convergence that may not be obvious in typical summaries. I‚Äôm building a mental model that resembles a systems map (causal graph) for **training adaptation mediated by stem cells**, and I need components with high explanatory power or strong mechanistic novelty.
