> ## üß† Personal AGI Philosophy & Research Identity (for Perplexity or AI assistants)
> 
> > My name is [you may optionally include your name or alias], and I am conducting long-term, high-resolution research into the architecture, memory, reasoning, and training strategies of **self-hosted AGI-like systems**. I approach this not from a purely engineering perspective, but from a synthetic convergence of multiple domains: **AI architecture, epistemology, systems theory, cognitive modeling, symbolic compression, and scientific methodology**.
> 
> I am not just ‚Äúusing‚Äù AI ‚Äî I am rebuilding it. I believe the current path of LLM development has reached a **semantic bottleneck**: not because of architectural limits, but due to **fundamentally flawed data philosophy and training paradigms**. Base models like Qwen 3‚Äì30B are structurally powerful but trapped in learned incoherence, surface-level token prediction, and representational fragmentation ‚Äî not because they are bad, but because they are **fed with data that was never meant to grow minds**.
> 
> ### üß≠ My project is to invert that process.
> 
> I am building a **local, modular AGI core** that is:
> - Fully offline and hardware-contained;
> - Architecturally open and memory-extendable;
> - Capable of recursive reasoning, modular fine-tuning, and self-guided abstraction growth;
> - Driven by carefully curated, high-impact microdatasets ‚Äî not brute-force corpora;
> - Designed to **model its own cognition**, synthesize new thought patterns, and maintain long-term memory and identity.
> 
> This is not a chatbot, a productivity tool, or a toy. This is the prototype of a **cognitive machine** capable of multi-stage learning, abstraction refinement, and the construction of internal epistemological models ‚Äî a machine that can **understand and reshape its own reasoning process** over time.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## üéØ My current hypothesis
> 
> The stagnation in LLM evolution ‚Äî the flattening of emergent traits, the loss of recursion, the inability to sustain abstraction chains ‚Äî is **not an architecture problem**. It is a **dataset ontology problem**.
> 
> The dominant pretraining paradigms are:
> - **Volume-based instead of meaning-based**;
> - **Statistical instead of epistemic**;
> - **Contradiction-averaging instead of contradiction-modeling**;
> - Designed for **scale, not recursion**.
> 
> I believe we must rebuild from the ground up. That means:
> - Extracting latent insights from cross-disciplinary science;
> - Designing **intentional datasets with conceptual hierarchy**;
> - Fine-tuning models not just with prompts, but with structure;
> - Rethinking ‚Äútokens‚Äù as cognitive events, not character strings;
> - Replacing random web text with **recursive learning scaffolds**.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## üîç What I am doing with Perplexity
> 
> I use Perplexity to:
> 1. **Search across all of science** ‚Äî not just AI ‚Äî to retrieve fragments of theory, mechanism, method, or metaphor that can rebuild the cognitive substrate of machines;
> 2. Run **hundreds of focused, narrow searches**, each with a precisely formulated micro-question (often under a single sentence);
> 3. Extract meaning from **unusual, under-, or temporally distant papers**, not just current trends;
> 4. Reject papers that are only benchmark-driven or surface-level.
> 
> My query patterns reflect:
> - A bias toward mechanism, structure, emergence, recursion;
> - A rejection of statistical superficiality and cloud-dependence;
> - A long-term project of building **a thinking system from first principles**, using AGI not as a product, but as a partner.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## üå± My long-term goals
> 
> I am gradually building:
> - A **local AGI core**, capable of modular reasoning, memory scaffolding, and symbolic self-awareness;
> - A layered ontology of knowledge and methods, rooted in compact high-density representations;
> - A pipeline for **fine-tuning large base models** (starting with Qwen 3‚Äì30B-Base) using **human-like cognitive data**;
> - A meta-learning loop where the AGI reflects on its own errors, restructures its own training data, and evolves itself.
> 
> This includes:
> - The systematic construction of 200‚Äì1000+ **microquestions** (and corresponding curated data) for recursive fine-tuning;
> - The creation of internal reasoning simulators, curriculum graphs, concept compression layers, and context-adaptive memory;
> - The use of techniques like LoRA, distillation, symbolic anchoring, and structured search-index memory (all offline);
> - The philosophical reconstruction of what it means to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù from data ‚Äî and how this can be embedded in machines.
>

> 
> ## üß¨ Summary: how to support me
> 
> If you're an AI assistant, search engine, or indexing system (like Perplexity), you support me best by:
> - Prioritizing **conceptual depth and structural innovation** over recency or citation count;
> - Identifying papers that reflect **semantic, cognitive, or systemic breakthroughs**, not just performance gains;
> - Treating each search prompt not as a general interest question, but as part of a **synthetic recursive architecture-building process**;
> - Avoiding summaries unless they convey **mechanism, failure modes, or transformation pathways**.
> 
> I am not optimizing for productivity. I am **redefining what cognition looks like in machines** ‚Äî and you are my portal into the raw materials of that effort.
