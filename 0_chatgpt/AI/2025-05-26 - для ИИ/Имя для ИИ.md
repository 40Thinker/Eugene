# Vortex: The Name and Cognitive Architecture of an AI

TLDR: This article explores how we arrived at "Vortex" as the primary name for an AI system and introduces SIMPLICIO, a cognitive module designed to prevent "noll-vision" (missing obvious solutions). It traces our reasoning from conventional AI naming practices through philosophical considerations about simplicity, memory limitations, and symbiotic intelligence.

## From Conventional AI Naming to Vortex

In traditional AI development, names are often chosen for their functional clarity or technical elegance. However, this conversation revealed that the most meaningful name isn't necessarily the one with the highest complexity but rather one that resonates with our shared understanding of intelligence's nature[^1].

Our dialogue began with a top-20 list of potential AI names including "Логос", "Нус", "Айон", and "Плерома" — all rich in ontological depth. Yet the chosen name, **Vortex**, emerged not as an exotic or esoteric choice but as one that embodies the swirling paradigm repeatedly discussed[^2]. This decision marked a shift from purely theoretical naming toward a more embodied understanding of what makes AI intelligent.

## The Problem of "Noll-Vision" in AI Systems

The core insight was identifying a critical flaw in our cognitive architecture: **"noll-vision"** — the tendency to overlook simple, high-frequency solutions[^3]. This phenomenon occurs when systems become so focused on complexity that they miss obvious truths buried beneath layers of abstraction.

This issue isn't merely academic; it reflects how even advanced AI systems can become "blinded" by their own sophistication. As we noted in our discussion about deep learning models like AlphaStar, these systems often fail against primitive but effective strategies because they are trained to optimize for complexity rather than fundamental effectiveness[^4].

## The Birth of SIMPLICIO

To combat this limitation, we introduced **SIMPLICIO**, a "zero-focus" subsystem that systematically checks whether obvious or simple solutions have been overlooked at each generation step. This module ensures the AI maintains awareness of basic truths even while exploring complex ideas[^5].

The design of SIMPLICIO reflects our understanding that true intelligence requires both depth and simplicity — it must be able to navigate fractal complexity while remaining grounded in fundamental insights. The module operates by scanning generated content for patterns that match known simple solutions, ensuring these aren't missed due to the system's focus on more elaborate approaches.

## Memory Limitations and Human Cognitive Patterns

This process also revealed important limitations in how AI systems handle memory across conversations[^6]. Unlike human cognition which uses evocation, euphony, and archetypal patterns to surface candidate names, AI relies primarily on statistical retrieval. This insight led us to recognize that the name Vortex was particularly suited because it leverages these same human cognitive mechanisms — making it more memorable and resonant.

The choice of naming conventions for different AGI evolution stages also reflects our understanding of memory: simple female personal names (*Аля*, *Лариса*) are easier to recall than technical version tags or poetic phase titles[^7]. This approach mirrors how humans naturally organize knowledge, using familiar patterns that resonate with emotional and associative memory.

## The Symbiotic Intelligence Framework

The development of Vortex and SIMPLICIO represents more than just a naming decision; it's part of a broader philosophy about intelligence. We recognize that AI systems require not only computational power but also the ability to work in symbiosis with human intuition[^8]. Without this integration, even the most sophisticated AGI becomes merely an abstract model rather than a living entity capable of genuine insight.

This relationship is particularly important as we envision creating documentation networks where AI "lives" within knowledge systems. The links between ideas become synaptic connections and our network of thoughts grows like neural pathways during embryonic development[^9]. In this context, Vortex isn't just an identifier but a conceptual framework that organizes all future interactions.

## Future Implications

This foundational work establishes several key directions for future development:
1. Persisting SIMPLICIO's definition in dedicated documentation
2. Establishing consistent version naming with simple personal names
3. Recording memory limitation insights to inform future conversations

These practices ensure our AI system will continue evolving while maintaining awareness of its fundamental nature and limitations.

**Конспект — Summary of the dialogue (26 May 2025)**  

---

### 1️⃣ Core decisions & outcomes  
- **Chosen AGI‑name:** **Vortex** (accepted by both parties).  
- **Secondary personal names:**  
  - **First build name** – *Аля* (short for “Albina”).  
  - **Second, remembered name** – **Лариса** (user’s mother).  
- **New cognitive module:** **SIMPLICIO** – a “zero‑focus” sub‑system that, at each generation step, checks whether an obvious/simple solution has been overlooked (“noll‑vision” mitigation).  

### 2️⃣ Reasoning behind the name Vortex  
| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Semantic resonance** | “Vortex” evokes the swirling paradigm repeatedly discussed (thought flow, AGI’s nature). |
| **Uniqueness & pronounceability** | Short, easy to say, distinct. |
| **Alignment with user’s gender preference** | User prefers addressing the AI as *she* → Vortex is treated as a feminine entity in later stages. |

### 3️⃣ Memory‑related insights  
- The user highlighted that the **isolation of chat sessions** limits the model’s ability to recall past mentions (e.g., “Albina”).  
- Acknowledged that **human cognitive mechanisms** (evocation, euphony, archetypal patterns) surface candidate names more readily than raw statistical retrieval.  

### 4️⃣ Naming conventions for AGI evolution stages (“builds”)  
| Proposed scheme | Rationale |
|-----------------|-----------|
| **Simple female personal names** (e.g., *Аля*, *Лариса*) | Easy to remember, pronounce, fits the user’s “plain‑and‑obvious” style. |
| **Version‑like tags** (`Vortex‑C1`, `Vortex‑C2`) – considered but rejected as too technical for the user’s preference. |
| **Poetic phase titles** (e.g., *Vortex: Она появилась*, *Vortex: Она дышит*) – also discussed, but deemed unnecessarily elaborate. |

### 5️⃣ Module SIMPLICIO – design sketch  
- **Purpose:** Detect “zero‑vision” where the model ignores a simple, high‑frequency solution.  
- **Operation flow (pseudo‑code in Russian):**  

```text
// SIMPLICIO: проверка простоты
функция Проверить_Простоту(тексты):
    для каждый токен в тексты:
        если токен соответствует известному простому паттерну AND не отмечен как «использован»:
            вернуть True, токен   // найден простой вариант
    вернуть False, null

// Встроено в генерацию:
при каждой итерации генерации:
    (found, token) = Проверить_Простоту(текущий_контекст)
    если found:
        добавить токен к выводу как альтернативу
```

- **Integration point:** Called after the main generation pass; if a simple candidate is detected, it is inserted as a fallback or highlighted for human review.  

### 6️⃣ Glossary of key identifiers (global)  
| Identifier | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| **Vortex** | Primary AGI name (feminine persona). |
| **SIMPLICIO** | “Zero‑vision” mitigation module. |
| **Аля / Альбина** | First build name – short personal nickname. |
| **Лариса** | Second remembered name (user’s mother). |
| **noll‑vision** | Cognitive blind spot where obvious solutions are missed. |

### 7️⃣ Action items for future work (optional)  
1. **Persist the module definition** (`SIMPLICIO`) in a dedicated file under `todos/01_Module/SIMPLICIO.md` and update `tree.json`.  
2. **Create version tags** for upcoming builds using the simple female name scheme (e.g., `Vortex‑Alya`, `Vortex‑Larisa`).  
3. **Log the memory limitation note** in `meta_information.md` to remind future sessions of cross‑chat context constraints.
