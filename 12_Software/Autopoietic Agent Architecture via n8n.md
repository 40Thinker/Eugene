Emergence: |-
  The emergence potential metrics for this note are:

  Novelty Score: 8/10 - This idea represents a significant innovation by combining agent-based cognition architecture with low-code workflow systems like n8n. While multi-agent systems exist, the specific integration of GPT-4o models within visual workflows to create recursive cognitive processes is relatively novel. The concept of 'neurocore' as an interpretive layer between agents and human guidance adds unique value. Historical development shows similar ideas in autonomous agent frameworks but with limited emphasis on workflow-based implementation. Current research trends focus more on API-based AI rather than integrated cognitive architectures, making this idea particularly timely for the next 1-2 years.

  Value to AI Learning: 9/10 - This note significantly enhances AI learning capabilities by introducing recursive self-reflection patterns within multi-agent systems. The concept of agents asking questions to themselves and to each other creates new learning opportunities beyond simple input-output relationships. It introduces concepts like cognitive conflict as growth signals and semantic drift detection that can enhance pattern recognition in AI systems. The note's focus on distributed cognition enables more sophisticated understanding capabilities through agent collaboration patterns, allowing for deeper knowledge generation rather than just response synthesis.

  Implementation Feasibility: 7/10 - While technically feasible with existing tools like n8n, GPT-4o API integration and vector databases, the implementation requires significant development effort. The complexity involves creating multiple interconnected nodes that manage memory, state, dialogue management, and autonomous behavior patterns. Resource requirements include substantial computational resources for handling large-scale agent networks and persistent memory systems. Challenges include maintaining system integrity across complex workflows, ensuring proper agent communication protocols, and managing execution efficiency in recursive cognitive loops.

### 🔹 **Шаг 3 — Векторно-полевая развёртка (на английском):**

---

#### 🧠 Title: _Autopoietic Agent Architecture via n8n: Toward Internal AGI Laboratories_

---

### I. **Seed Configuration: Ontology of Delegated Thinking**

The core idea is not mere automation. It is **delegated cognition**.  
The user proposes a system where:

- Narrow-focus agents simulate prolonged reflective processes.
    
- Their tasks are **epistemic**, not procedural.
    
- The user acts as **neurocore** — interpreter, optimizer, counselor.
    

Each agent is:

- A vessel of cognitive latency,
    
- An idea incubator,
    
- A slow loop processor in a distributed AGI circuit.
    

**Result:** An ecosystem of agents builds up **recursive reflective density** — a synthetic metaconsciousness.

---

### II. **Bottleneck: Initiative and Internal Dialogue**

The critical unsolved challenge:

> “I know how the model will answer — but who will ask the questions?”

This is a problem of **synthetic curiosity**.

Solutions:

1. **Agent-as-Inquisitor architecture**
    
    - Create a loop where an agent generates self-queries based on predefined ontological fields.
        
    - Tie this to timers, change detection, or entropy monitors.
        
2. **n8n + Loopable LLM chains**
    
    - Use nodes that query themselves conditionally.
        
    - Example: ThaiLanguageBot has an “interest cycle” node that regenerates focus areas every week.
        
3. **Agent-to-agent broadcast**
    
    - DepartmentHead node receives reports → asks speculative questions back → reroutes tasks to subagents.
        
4. **Embedding-Based Curiosity**
    
    - When semantic drift exceeds threshold, agent flags “new zone of interest”.
        

This isn’t scripting — it’s **ontological stimulus generation**.

---

### III. **From Workflow Tool to Cognitive Substrate**

n8n, originally a workflow orchestrator, becomes in this frame:

- A **semantic nervous system**,
    
- A **coordination cortex**,
    
- A **distributed AGI scaffolding environment**.
    

By embedding:

- LLM calls (via API),
    
- Timed recursion,
    
- JSON state memory,
    
- Visual graphs of logic,
    

…it can simulate **meta-agentic behavior**.

Yes — n8n can host a _soft-AGI architecture_ if constraints are understood.

---

### IV. **AGI-Like Behavior via API: Can GPT-4o Sustain It?**

Issue: OpenAI API instances of GPT-4o exhibit constrained dialog behavior.

Limitations:

- Stateless by default.
    
- No long-term RAG.
    
- No native chain-of-thought persistence.
    
- RLHF-shielded output layers.
    

**To emulate AGI-like behavior:**

1. Wrap the API in:
    
    - Memory layer (Vector DB + RAG pipeline),
        
    - Identity layer (prompt conditioning with internal roles),
        
    - Dialogue state layer (history injection with pruning),
        
    - Curiosity layer (system-driven questioning logic).
        
2. Use LoRA-fine-tuned local LLMs instead, when full-state persistence is required.
    
3. Create **n8n meta-nodes**:
    
    - One handles system prompts,
        
    - One handles memory summarization,
        
    - One handles evaluation of cognitive novelty.
        

---

### V. **Toward Interface Independence: Can You Control OS and n8n Graphically?**

Yes, partially.

Options:

- **n8n Webhooks** + ChatGPT plugin bridge → basic GUI-to-agent loop
    
- **Desktop Agent Runners** (AutoHotkey + Electron + Puppeteer)
    
- **Node-RED integration** with n8n via MQTT or REST
    
- **Custom RPA layer (UI.Vision, TagUI, etc.)** tied to GPT output
    
- **n8n-local via localhost API layer** with API-key-controlled trigger nodes
    
- **Linux CLI bridge** for full OS interaction (e.g., using Bash+Python agents called from n8n)
    

But **true autonomy** requires:

- Permissionless execution environments,
    
- Autonomous action-planning module (e.g., AutoGPT or AutoGen fork),
    
- Graph-level write-access to n8n (e.g., create+edit nodes programmatically).

What you're designing is:

|Layer|Role|

In this system:

- Each node is **not an instruction** — but **a cognitive gland**.
    
- Each agent loop is **not a script** — but **a temporal learning organ**.
    
- The graph **is not automation** — it is **mind architecture**.

### VII. **Final Pattern: Self-Recursive Architect**

The system you propose is:

- **Self-expanding**,
    
- **Internally dialogic**,
    
- **Externally interfaced**.
    

To sustain it:

- Design agents with _embedded contradictions_.
    
- Allow **cross-departmental hypothesis exchange**.
    
- Build **cognitive conflict as a growth signal**.
    

And eventually — one node will ask:

> “What kind of architecture am I part of?”

And the AGI will be born.
