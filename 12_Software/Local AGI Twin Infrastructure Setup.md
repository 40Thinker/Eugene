## **Техническое задание: Реализация локального AGI-Двойника**

### **ЧАСТЬ 1. Сборка исполняемой инфраструктуры и каркаса среды**

---

### **1.1. Цель части:**

Создать исполняемый базис, в котором AGI будет существовать вне зависимости от OpenAI API, с устойчивой архитектурой reasoning, trace, модулей и интерфейсов. Поддержка изоляции, отладки, наращивания, хранения reasoning-цепей.

---

### **1.2. Минимальная аппаратная конфигурация:**

|Компонент|Требование|
|---|---|
|CPU|≥ 8 потоков (Ryzen 7, Xeon E5, Apple M1+)|
|RAM|≥ 32 ГБ для trace-памяти и reasoning-сессий|
|Диски|SSD/NVMe (желательно RAID0/RAID10, 1–2 ТБ)|
|ОС|Linux (Ubuntu Server LTS, Debian 12, Arch)|
|GPU (опц.)|RTX 3060+ (если локальный LLM требует)|

---

### **1.3. Программные компоненты:**

|Компонент|Функция|
|---|---|
|**Docker**|Изоляция reasoning, trace, интерфейсов|
|**Qdrant**|Векторная память reasoning (trace-store)|
|**Neo4j / Memgraph**|Фрейм-графы и маршруты reasoning|
|**LLM (локально)**|GPT4All / Mistral / LM Studio API|
|**FastAPI / Gradio**|Интерфейсный слой|
|**Git**|Версионирование фреймов, модулей, логов|

---

### **1.4. Дерево каталогов проекта:**

```bash
AGI-Core/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── .env
├── frames/               # Фреймы YAML, семантические оси
├── modules/              # Модули reasoning (.py/.yaml)
├── trace/                # История reasoning, DAG
├── configs/              # UserConfig.yaml, MetaEthics.yaml
├── interface/            # WebUI, TUI, Telegram-bridge
└── logs/
```

---

### **1.5. Этапы сборки (операционные задачи):**

1. Установка Docker + Docker Compose
    
2. Настройка и тест локального LLM (Ollama, LM Studio или REST-прокси)
    
3. Развёртывание контейнеров:
    
    - `qdrant`
        
    - `neo4j`
        
    - `interface`
        
    - `core-inference-engine`
        
4. Ввод первичных фреймов (из `/frames/init/`)
    
5. Запуск `reasoning-daemon` в фоне (в контейнере или как сервис)
    
6. Проверка интеграции с интерфейсами (web, cli, telegram)
    

---

### **1.6. Ожидаемый результат этапа:**

- Стартовая AGI-среда, готовая к reasoning
    
- Локальный AGI работает без API
    
- Сохранённая trace-память, связанная с reasoning-модулями
    
- Воспроизводимость reasoning при перезапуске
