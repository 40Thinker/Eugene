**1. Structural Intent: Disentangling Retrieval and Reasoning**

The core proposal is not just technical — it reflects an **architectural decoupling** of layers in an AGI system:

Each path carries different **cognitive valence**:

- Web Search = Novelty
    
- Local Search = Memory
    
- Reformulated RAG = Alignment

**3. Role of `n8n`: Event Graph as Cognitive Cortex**

n8n becomes the **synthetic prefrontal cortex**:

- Determines which agents activate.
    
- Routes outputs through validation, deduplication, compression.
    
- Maintains state across multi-turn dialogues.
    
- Provides _conditional branching_ based on availability, confidence, or user signal.
    

This allows for **agentic flexibility without mutating the LLM itself**.

---

**4. Strengths of the Architecture**

- **No source code changes** to existing models — use them as black boxes.
    
- **Semantic richness via divergence** — input is simultaneously interpreted from 3+ perspectives.
    
- **Scalability** — local search + AI context + web context scale independently.
    
- **Contextual optimization** — summarization agents reduce token overload.
    
- **Parallel execution** — no need to wait for serial interpretation.
    

This is AGI **as pipeline, not as monolith**.

---

**5. Challenges and Trade-Offs**

- **Latency**: Depending on parallel execution limits, this could introduce delay (especially web + local + reformulation).
    
- **Ranking Complexity**: Merging results into a final prompt requires advanced scoring of relevance, diversity, and semantic overlap.
    
- **Token Budget Arbitration**: Need for intelligent summarizers and context prioritizers to avoid overflow in the final model’s input.
    

All of these are **solvable at the orchestration layer**, especially with embedded cost heuristics.

---

**6. Emergent Intelligence: Synthetic Foresight**

A key property of this setup: it mirrors **how human experts consult diverse sources** before making conclusions.

- The reformulator is a "meta-understander";
    
- Local search is "archival recall";
    
- Web search is "external horizon scanning".
    

Their combination feeds the **real-time actor**, who integrates the weighted insights.

This is not retrieval. It’s **epistemic triangulation**.

---

**7. AGI-Relevant Implications**

- Encourages **modular self-reasoning**;
    
- Enables **interpretability through traceable flow**;
    
- Allows **non-linear prompt development**;
    
- Encourages **emergent memory consolidation** (e.g., summarization layers could generate new memories on-the-fly).
    

---

**8. Evaluation: Feasibility and Path to Deployment**

**Technically feasible today.** What’s needed:

- Local search engine (e.g., Recoll, Docugami, Obsidian-based)
    
- API-accessible web search wrapper (e.g., Serper, Tavily)
    
- LoRA-tuned 1.3–7B reformulation model
    
- Summarizer (e.g., Phi-2 or Qwen 1.5)
    
- n8n orchestration with webhook interface to final model (e.g., LM Studio, vLLM server)
    

**No major barriers exist.** It’s primarily an _integration challenge_, not a research frontier.

---

**9. Closing Reflection**

This is **a blueprint for orchestration-level AGI** — a model where cognition emerges not from a single LLM, but from the **coordination of modular, purpose-specific agents**, each contributing a different epistemic function.

The intelligence no longer lives in a model.

It lives in **the space between them**.
