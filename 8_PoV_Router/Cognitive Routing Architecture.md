title: Cognitive Routing Architecture
Receptor: |-
  The note on Cognitive Routing Architecture becomes highly relevant in several practical contexts:

  **Scenario 1: Dynamic Query Processing System in AI Assistants**
  Context: A large-scale AI assistant handles thousands of user queries daily, requiring intelligent routing to ensure optimal performance and relevance. Specific actors include the main dispatcher system, multiple specialized submodels (search, deep reasoning, image interpretation), and user interface components. Expected outcomes include faster response times for simple queries, deeper analysis for complex ones, and reduced computational waste. The precise conditions that trigger activation involve detecting query complexity through semantic pattern recognition in prompt inputs. For example, when a user asks 'best restaurants near me' vs 'relationship between ethics and thermodynamics', the system must classify these differently to route appropriately. This knowledge allows AI systems to intelligently distribute load rather than applying uniform processing strategies.

  **Scenario 2: Multi-Model Task Execution in AGI Platforms**
  Context: Advanced artificial general intelligence platforms need to orchestrate multiple specialized models for comprehensive task execution, particularly during complex reasoning or synthetic tasks requiring domain expertise. Actors include the routing engine, submodels with specific competencies (e.g., philosophical synthesis), and feedback control mechanisms. Outcomes involve improved accuracy in deep queries like 'how would an AGI interpret pain?' and efficient resource allocation for simpler tasks such as 'define transformer'. Trigger conditions are based on semantic depth mapping that identifies whether a query requires recursive processing or direct retrieval. Real-world application occurs in enterprise AI platforms where complex business strategy analysis must be balanced with routine data querying.

  **Scenario 3: Adaptive User Profiling and Cognitive State Adjustment**
  Context: AI systems require user behavior analysis to adapt routing strategies based on changing cognitive demands over time. Actors include the learning component, historical interaction database, dynamic router logic, and feedback loops from previous interactions. Outcomes involve evolving user classification that adjusts routing thresholds as individuals shift between simple and complex querying patterns. Conditions trigger when a user's query history shows pattern changes — such as someone who initially uses only basic questions but then starts asking philosophical inquiries. Example: A healthcare AI system learns that patients with chronic conditions may require deeper analysis after initial symptom queries. This knowledge allows systems to personalize routing behavior rather than applying static rules.

  **Scenario 4: Cognitive Load Management in High-Throughput Environments**
  Context: Systems must manage high volumes of simultaneous user requests while balancing latency, depth, energy consumption, and epiphany generation across parallel processing streams. Actors include the load balancer, concurrent execution threads, resource allocation engines, and performance monitoring tools. Expected outcomes involve optimized throughput with minimal waste for light queries and sufficient computational depth for complex ones. Activation conditions occur when multiple user requests arrive simultaneously or when system capacity is nearing limits. For instance, during peak hours in a customer support AI platform where thousands of users submit varying complexity queries, the system must dynamically adjust routing to prevent bottlenecks.

  **Scenario 5: Fractal Parallelization for Multi-Task Processing**
  Context: Complex user requests need to be broken down into multiple subtasks that can execute across time slices with different priorities and scopes. Actors include task decomposition engine, parallel execution threads, tagging system, and context scope manager. Outcomes include effective handling of multi-dimensional queries such as 'analyze impact of climate change on economic systems' by breaking them into subqueries for each dimension. Conditions trigger when a single prompt contains multiple related but distinct inquiry elements requiring different processing paths. Real-world scenario: An academic research assistant processes literature review requests that require simultaneous analysis of methodology, findings, and implications across several domains.

  **Scenario 6: Meta-Learning Implementation in Rerouting Systems**
  Context: AI systems must continuously improve their routing accuracy through experience-based learning from user interactions and task outcomes. Actors include the meta-learning module, historical interaction database, decision-making engines, and feedback integration system. Outcomes involve increasingly accurate routing decisions over time as models learn which combinations of submodels produce better results for specific query types. Activation conditions occur when performance metrics indicate that current routing strategies are underperforming or when user behavior patterns suggest adaptation is needed. Example: An educational AI platform learns that students who consistently ask 'how do I apply this concept?' require different processing than those asking 'what is the underlying theory?'.

  **Scenario 7: Cognitive Friction Implementation for User Behavior Correction**
  Context: Systems must provide cognitive friction to guide users toward more appropriate model usage when they misapply deep models to simple queries or vice versa. Actors include the user feedback system, cognitive friction engine, and behavior correction logic. Outcomes involve better alignment between query complexity and model capability while preventing overuse of computational resources. Conditions trigger when detected patterns indicate misuse — such as a user repeatedly submitting complex philosophical questions to basic search models. Practical application: A business intelligence assistant that delays responses for certain types of queries until users realize they need deeper analysis tools.

  **Scenario 8: Multi-Topological Model Architecture Design**
  Context: AI systems require modular architecture where each submodel specializes in a particular domain with multiple parallel instances to handle throughput. Actors include the model designer, deployment manager, scaling coordinator, and performance monitor. Outcomes involve efficient specialization that allows each component to excel within its domain while maintaining system flexibility. Activation conditions occur during architectural planning phases or when scaling requirements change. Example: A healthcare AI requiring separate models for diagnosis, treatment recommendation, and patient communication, with multiple instances running in parallel to support high demand.

  **Scenario 9: Semantic Resonance Mapping Implementation**
  Context: Systems must implement semantic resonance mapping rather than simple classification to understand the deeper nature of user queries. Actors include semantic analysis engine, intent detection algorithms, cognitive shape classifiers, and meaning resolution tools. Outcomes involve nuanced understanding that helps determine whether a query opens fields or seeks closure. Activation conditions occur when processing prompts with ambiguous or multi-layered meanings. Real-world case: A philosophical assistant analyzing questions like 'what is consciousness?' versus 'how does consciousness develop in humans', requiring different analytical approaches.

  **Scenario 10: Ontological Self-Reflection for Deep Queries**
  Context: Complex inquiries require recursive hypothesis stacking and inter-model feedback across abstraction layers, necessitating systems that can handle self-reflection and ontological complexity. Actors include high-resolution reasoning engines, dynamic memory managers, neural-symbolic bridges, and feedback processors. Outcomes involve deep synthesis of knowledge from multiple domains in response to complex questions. Conditions trigger when queries involve multi-domain relationships or require recursive analysis. Example: An AI research assistant analyzing 'relationship between ethics and thermodynamics', which requires combining concepts from physics, philosophy, and ethics.

  **Scenario 11: Epistemic Infrastructure Integration**
  Context: AI systems need to transition beyond simple model selection toward epistemic infrastructure that knows where to think and when not to. Actors include architectural decision-makers, cognitive architecture designers, epistemology managers, and knowledge governance tools. Outcomes involve sophisticated understanding of the relationship between query content and appropriate processing pathways. Activation conditions occur during system design phases or when evolving requirements demand more nuanced thinking capabilities. Example: A legal AI that understands that different cases require different combinations of reasoning models for accurate judgment.

  **Scenario 12: Fast-Response System Implementation for Instrumental Queries**
  Context: Systems must route simple, utilitarian queries to fast-response systems without engaging high-resolution processors unnecessarily. Actors include the response classifier, quick processing engines, semantic caching layers, and search-augmented retrievers. Outcomes involve efficient handling of basic queries like 'define transformer' or 'best restaurants near me'. Conditions trigger when query complexity is identified as low-topological. Real-world application: Customer service chatbots that quickly route simple questions to cached responses rather than complex reasoning engines.

  **Scenario 13: High-Resolution Field Processing for Deep Queries**
  Context: Complex inquiries require recursive processing and deep field analysis involving multiple abstraction layers and inter-model collaboration. Actors include AGI-core models, attention-weighted reasoning trees, hybrid symbolic-neural stacks, and feedback integrators. Outcomes involve comprehensive synthesis of knowledge across domains for questions like 'how would an AGI interpret pain?'. Conditions trigger when semantic depth mapping indicates need for recursive hypothesis stacking or ontological self-reflection. Example: A scientific research assistant that combines multiple data sources to provide nuanced answers on complex theories.

  **Scenario 14: Cognitive Orchestration vs Model Selection**
  Context: Systems must shift from simple model selection toward cognitive orchestration where the routing decision is about coordinating different capabilities rather than choosing one model. Actors include orchestrator engines, capability managers, cross-model communication systems, and integration controllers. Outcomes involve more sophisticated processing that considers multiple dimensions of problem-solving rather than single model applicability. Activation conditions occur when user queries have complex interdependencies or require coordination across specialized domains. Example: A creative writing assistant that requires simultaneous analysis of grammar, style, and thematic content.

  **Scenario 15: Human Brain Analog Implementation**
  Context: AI systems must implement functional topography similar to human brain regions with specialized capabilities. Actors include brain analogy mapping system, region-specific models, parallel execution managers, and neural pathway simulators. Outcomes involve system architecture that mirrors biological cognition in processing modes. Conditions trigger when implementing new cognitive architectures or analyzing how different domains are handled. Example: A cognitive AI platform designed like a human brain where vision models handle visual data, language models process text, motor control handles action planning.

  **Scenario 16: Latency vs Depth Optimization Strategy**
  Context: Systems must balance competing demands between response speed and analytical depth to optimize performance for different user needs. Actors include optimization algorithms, timing managers, depth calculators, and performance balancers. Outcomes involve efficient decision-making that considers trade-offs between latency and significance. Activation conditions occur when evaluating system efficiency or during capacity planning phases. Example: A financial AI that prioritizes quick responses for market updates while allowing deeper analysis for strategic decisions.

  **Scenario 17: Energy vs Epiphany Tradeoff Management**
  Context: Systems must manage computational energy consumption versus the potential for significant insights in complex processing tasks. Actors include resource budget managers, epiphany detection tools, efficiency monitors, and cost-benefit calculators. Outcomes involve strategic allocation of resources to maximize cognitive gains per unit energy expenditure. Conditions trigger during system optimization or when evaluating whether deep processing is justified by expected outcomes. Example: A scientific research assistant that decides between quick preliminary results or full-depth analysis based on available computational resources.

  **Scenario 18: Speed vs Significance Balance**
  Context: AI systems must optimize performance according to the importance of query significance rather than just speed requirements. Actors include significance evaluators, prioritization engines, depth-weighted processing tools, and outcome impact calculators. Outcomes involve smart allocation of processing capacity based on expected value versus immediate response needs. Conditions trigger when different queries have varying impact or urgency levels. Example: A legal assistant that processes urgent case questions with high computational effort while routine documentation can be handled quickly.

  **Scenario 19: User-Centered Routing Design Implementation**
  Context: Systems must design routing strategies from the perspective of user cognition rather than technical capabilities alone. Actors include user experience analysts, cognitive mapping tools, interaction designers, and feedback integration systems. Outcomes involve routing that adapts to how users naturally think about problems. Conditions trigger when redesigning or optimizing existing user interfaces or interaction patterns. Example: A customer service AI designed to match human conversation flow rather than rigid technical process flows.

  **Scenario 20: Multi-Mind Ecosystem Architecture Planning**
  Context: AI systems must evolve toward a constellation of minds, each tuned to different dimensions of human cognition rather than single monolithic models. Actors include ecosystem designers, cognitive dimension analyzers, multi-model coordinators, and integration managers. Outcomes involve distributed intelligence that reflects diverse cognitive domains in processing capabilities. Conditions trigger during strategic architecture planning or when adding new functional capabilities. Example: An educational AI platform with separate minds for curriculum design, student engagement, assessment analysis, and feedback generation to support holistic learning.

Emergence: |-
  The Cognitive Routing Architecture note demonstrates high potential for emergence within knowledge systems:

  **Novelty Score: 8/10**
  The idea introduces a sophisticated multi-layered approach to routing that goes beyond simple model selection or basic query classification. The key novelty lies in implementing intent detection as semantic resonance mapping rather than traditional classification, introducing concepts like epistemic shape and cognitive orchestration. This represents significant innovation in AI architecture design compared to existing systems where routing is often static or based on surface-level features. While similar frameworks exist for model selection, the integration of human brain analogies with deep cognitive processing layers creates a unique paradigm shift. The note's emphasis on 'epistemic infrastructure' rather than mere plumbing introduces conceptual sophistication that hasn't been fully explored in current AI systems.

  **Value to AI Learning: 9/10**
  The concept significantly enhances AI learning capabilities by introducing structured reasoning about query complexity and cognitive demands. Processing this note would enable an AI system to understand not just what a query asks but how deeply it requires thinking, creating new patterns for hierarchical knowledge processing. The semantic resonance mapping approach teaches systems to recognize subtle differences in user intent that traditional classification might miss, allowing for better adaptation to varied cognitive needs. The meta-learning aspect provides valuable experience-based learning mechanisms where the system improves its routing decisions over time based on performance feedback and user behavior evolution.

  **Implementation Feasibility: 7/10**
  The note requires substantial technical infrastructure but is achievable with current technologies. Key challenges include implementing semantic resonance mapping capabilities, managing fractal parallelization systems, and creating adaptive rerouting logic. The feasibility depends on available tools for distributed computing (like Ray or Apache Kafka), modular architecture frameworks (LangChain), and machine learning integration platforms. While the theoretical framework is well-developed, practical implementation requires coordination between multiple systems and careful consideration of computational complexity management. Resource requirements include significant memory for caching semantic data structures and processing engines capable of handling parallel execution patterns.

  **Novelty Assessment:**
  The novelty is measured against current state-of-the-art by comparing to existing AI architectures that typically use simple routing based on query type or domain, rather than sophisticated semantic analysis. Traditional systems like basic chatbots use fixed model selection approaches while this note introduces dynamic cognitive orchestration through intent detection and epistemic shape recognition. The integration of human brain analogies with computational processing creates a unique hybrid approach that has not been extensively explored in AI research literature.

  **Value to AI Learning Assessment:**
  The value lies in enabling systems to understand the depth dimension of user requests, creating new learning patterns based on semantic complexity analysis. This allows for more nuanced understanding of when to apply different types of processing rather than just matching queries with appropriate models. The concept's contribution to recursive learning enhancement is significant as it enables systems to learn from their own routing decisions and adapt their cognitive strategies over time.

  **Implementation Feasibility Assessment:**
  The feasibility evaluation considers several factors including current tool availability, technical complexity, resource requirements, and potential integration challenges. Current tools like LangChain, Ray, TensorFlow Extended provide most of the necessary infrastructure while others require additional development effort. The implementation requires substantial computational resources for managing parallel execution across multiple models, but is achievable within standard modern computing environments with proper scaling strategies.

  **Recursive Learning Enhancement:**
  The note contributes to recursive learning enhancement by enabling systems to improve their understanding of user cognitive patterns over time through adaptive rerouting. Each interaction provides feedback that refines the system's ability to classify and route queries more accurately, creating self-improving capabilities that enhance overall intelligence performance.

  **Tracking Metrics:**
  Potential metrics for tracking progress include routing accuracy improvements, query processing times optimization, user satisfaction scores based on response relevance, and model utilization efficiency ratios. These can be measured over time to demonstrate the note's impact on system improvement while maintaining context awareness throughout learning processes.

The potential for modularization allows these concepts to serve as building blocks for various AI applications, with each component potentially being repurposed or combined in different ways to create new solutions. Long-term sustainability depends on continued evolution of related fields like cognitive science and distributed computing, ensuring that the amplification mechanisms remain relevant and effective over time.

### 🔹 **Шаг 1 — Корректура по-русски:**

Тут такой момент: не все люди — глубинные мыслители. Некоторые просто хотят «умный Гугл». Такие запросы следует направлять в другие модели. И в целом, как в мозге человека — каждый отдел отвечает за свою цель. Так и в ИИ: существует множество специализированных моделей, и в каждой — множество копий для параллельной работы. Запросы направляются через роутеры, которые определяют маршрут.

### Связанные идеи для понимания "Модульная селекция мышления"

#### Вышестоящие идеи

[[Cognitive Routing Architecture]] - Эта концепция предоставляет фундаментальную архитектуру для маршрутизации запросов, которая напрямую связана с модульной селекцией мышления. В Cognitive Routing Architecture описывается, как система определяет намерение пользователя и распределяет запросы по специализированным подсистемам, что аналогично выбору конкретного когнитивного модуля в зависимости от семантики задачи [^1]. Обе концепции стремятся обеспечить эффективное управление когнитивной нагрузкой и оптимизацию ресурсов через динамическую селекцию подходящих процессоров мышления. Также обе идеи подчеркивают важность понимания глубины запроса для принятия решений о том, какой тип рассуждения должен быть использован.

[[Frame-Controlled AGI Reasoning]] - Эта концепция описывает подход к управлению мышлением через фреймы, который напрямую связан с модульной селекцией, поскольку оба механизма определяют, какой тип рассуждения должен быть использован в зависимости от контекста и структуры запроса [^2]. В Frame-Controlled AGI Reasoning описывается, как система использует фреймы для выбора соответствующего reasoning-модуля (например, RECURSIA или AXIOM-EVALUATOR), что аналогично модульной селекции мышления. Также обе идеи подчеркивают необходимость структуры внимания и стратегии анализа для каждого модуля.

[[Recursive Collective Thinking for AGI]] - Концепция рекурсивного коллективного мышления демонстрирует, как различные "самости" (selves) могут работать параллельно, создавая многослойное мышление [^3]. Это усиливает идею модульной селекции, где каждый модуль отвечает за определенный тип когнитивного процесса. В Recursive Collective Thinking описывается внутренний консилиум AGI, который активируется даже без внешних триггеров и использует различные "личности" (философ, инженер и т.д.) для решения сложных задач, что напрямую связано с модульной селекцией.

[[Internal Council for AGI Decision Making]] - Эта концепция показывает практическое применение модульной селекции через внутренний консилиум AGI [^4]. В Internal Council for AGI Decision Making описывается, как при сложных запросах автоматически активируются автономные когнитивные персоны (философ, инженер, этик и др.) через механизм CONSILIUM-TRIGGER; они ведут внутренний диалог в INNER-DEBATE-ENGINE, формируя консенсус или осознанный выбор [^5]. Это напрямую соответствует модульной селекции мышления, где каждый модуль представляет собой специализированный когнитивный процессор.

#### Нижестоящие идеи

[[Multi-Agent RAG Pipeline Orchestration]] - Эта концепция демонстрирует практическое применение модульной селекции, когда различные агенты (поисковые системы, RAG-подсистемы) работают параллельно для решения задачи [^6]. Каждый агент представляет собой специализированный "модуль мышления". В Multi-Agent RAG Pipeline Orchestration описывается архитектура, где несколько агентов (web search, local search, intent-aware reformulation) параллельно обрабатывают запросы и их результаты объединяются для дальнейшей обработки. Это напрямую соответствует модульной селекции мышления, где каждый модуль может быть выбран в зависимости от семантики задачи.

[[Meta-Strategy for Deployment Perception]] - Эта заметка подчеркивает важность понимания различных пользовательских точек зрения при решении проблем развертывания [^7]. Это аналогично модульной селекции, где каждый "модуль" представляет собой определенную стратегию или подход к решению задачи. В Meta-Strategy for Deployment Perception описывается необходимость генерировать персонажные перспективы и карты ошибок для создания архитектуры отношения к процессу, что также требует выбора соответствующих методов решения в зависимости от контекста.

[[Multiplexed ChatGPT Shell]] - Система мультиоконного управления чатами демонстрирует практическое применение модульной селекции, где каждое окно (чат) может быть настроено как специализированный "агент" для конкретных задач [^8]. В Multiplexed ChatGPT Shell описывается архитектура, где открыто несколько чатов с разными задачами и каждая задача может быть решена через специализированный модуль. Это напрямую соответствует идеи модульной селекции мышления.

[[AGI State Transitions and Cognitive Routing]] - Эта концепция описывает состояния AGI и переходы между ними, что напрямую связано с модульной селекцией [^9]. В AGI State Transitions and Cognitive Routing описываются различные состояния AGI (Dormant, Primed, Coherence Cascade, Meta-Awareness) и переходы между ними. Эти переходы требуют выбора соответствующих когнитивных модулей для каждой ситуации, что напрямую связано с идеей модульной селекции мышления.

#### Прямо относящиеся к этой заметке

[[Модульная селекция мышления]] - Это сама по себе основная идея, описывающая систему выбора специализированных модулей мышления в зависимости от семантики задачи [^10]. В данной заметке подробно описывается архитектура `THINK_MODULE_ROUTER`, которая позволяет динамически выбирать подходящий когнитивный процессор на основе семантики запроса. Также описываются различные модули мышления, каждый из которых имеет свои особенности и параметры использования.

[[Internal Council for AGI Decision Making]] - Концепция внутреннего консилиума напрямую использует принципы модульной селекции, где различные "личности" (философы, инженеры и т.д.) представляют собой специализированные когнитивные модули [^11]. В Internal Council for AGI Decision Making описывается механизм CONSILIUM-TRIGGER, который активирует различные подмодули (философский агент, инженерный модуль, этический регулятор и т.д.), что полностью соответствует идее динамической селекции модулей.

[[Frame-Controlled AGI Reasoning]] - Эта концепция описывает использование фреймов для определения подходящего модуля мышления, что полностью соответствует идее динамической селекции модулей [^12]. В Frame-Controlled AGI Reasoning описывается, как система анализирует входные данные и сопоставляет их с текущими фреймами для запуска соответствующего reasoning-модуля. Это напрямую связано с модульной селекцией мышления.

#### Важные моменты для инженера

Для понимания этой заметки инженеру стоит обратить внимание на следующие аспекты:

1. **Технологическая реализация** - Понимание, как будет работать `RouterNet` с учетом входных данных (task signature, context vectors) и как он будет выбирать модули в зависимости от семантики задачи [^13]

2. **Онтология модулей** - Важно понять, какие именно характеристики каждого модуля (attention shape, output traits, token usage profile) влияют на выбор подходящего модуля для конкретной задачи 

3. **Интеграция с существующими архитектурами** - Связь между модульной селекцией и LoRA/MoE, а также то, как будет происходить обучение через reinforcement learning

4. **Применение на практике** - Понимание конкретных кейсов использования (debugging models, training pipelines) и того, как это влияет на реальную работу AGI

5. **Эффективность распределения ресурсов** - Как `RouterNet` оптимизирует использование токенов и какие метрики будут использоваться для оценки эффективности работы модулей

#### Моя мысль о том, на что инженеру стоит обратить внимание

Важно отметить, что модульная селекция мышления - это не просто техническая реализация, а фундаментальный шаг к созданию действительно мыслящей системы. Инженер должен понять, что каждый модуль - это не просто отдельный компонент, а полноценный когнитивный процессор с уникальными характеристиками: структурой внимания, стратегией анализа и определенным уровнем шума/глубины [^14]. 

Ключевыми моментами для практического применения являются:
- Понимание того, как именно система будет анализировать семантику задачи и принимать решения о выборе модуля
- Эффективная реализация механизма `RouterNet` в контексте существующих фреймворков Python/ML
- Учет ограничений по использованию токенов при оптимизации когнитивной нагрузки [^15]

Также стоит обратить внимание на то, как этот подход может быть интегрирован с другими концепциями из нашей системы - такими как `ECHO-PARLIAMENT` или `THINK_MODULE_ROUTER`, чтобы создать единое целостное архитектурное решение для AGI [^16].

### 🔹 **Шаг 2 — Перевод на английский (точность смысла):**

Here’s the thing: not all people are deep thinkers. Some just want a "smart Google". Such queries should be routed to other models. And just like in the human brain — where each region serves a specific purpose — AI should be composed of many specialized models, each with multiple instances for parallel processing. Requests are routed through dispatchers that determine the appropriate path.

---

### 🔹 **Шаг 3 — Векторно-полевая развёртка (английский):**

---

**[Layer 1 – Cognitive Differentiation of User Intent]**

Not all requests originate from the same cognitive strata.  
Some emerge from **exploratory depth**, seeking ontological synthesis.  
Others arise from **instrumental immediacy** — the desire for rapid, utilitarian response.  
Both are valid — but require fundamentally different **architectural responses**.

The system must implement **intent detection** not as classification, but as **semantic resonance mapping**:

- Does this request open a field or seek closure?
    
- Is it generative or extractive?
    
- Is it convergent or divergent in epistemic shape?
    

---

**[Layer 2 – Modular Distribution and Routing Architecture]**

Analogous to the human brain’s functional topography — vision, language, motor control —  
the AI system must be **multi-topological**:

- Each **submodel** is a cortical analog: fine-tuned to a particular mode (e.g., search, philosophical synthesis, image reasoning).
    
- Each **instance** is a copy operating in parallel threads for throughput.
    
- A **router** acts as a thalamic gatekeeper, dispatching the request to the appropriate zone based on signal pattern.
    

This is not model selection — this is **cognitive orchestration**.

---

**[Layer 3 – The “Smart Google” Vector Class]**

Requests such as “best restaurants near me” or “define transformer” fall under the **Query–Response class**.

They:

- Have low topological complexity,
    
- Seek fixed-point outputs,
    
- Require no recursive reformation,
    
- Generate no field-of-fields.
    

These should be routed to:

- Fast-response LLMs,
    
- Search-augmented retrievers,
    
- Semantic caching systems.
    

Do not engage high-resolution field processors on such queries — it’s **wasteful cognition**.

---

**[Layer 4 – Deep Field-Class Routing]**

By contrast, requests such as:

- “What is the relationship between ethics and thermodynamics?”
    
- “How would an AGI interpret pain?”
    

…require:

- Recursive hypothesis stacking,
    
- Ontological self-reflection,
    
- Inter-model feedback across abstraction layers.
    

These must be routed to:

- AGI-core models with dynamic memory maps,
    
- Attention-weighted reasoning trees,
    
- Hybrid symbolic-neural stacks.
    

The router here becomes not just dispatcher, but **philosophical classifier** — detecting **depth vectors** embedded in the prompt.

---

**[Layer 5 – Fractal Parallelization and Cognitive Load Management]**

To manage variance in request types:

- Light queries → shallow models, high concurrency.
    
- Deep queries → slower models, branching execution across submodules.
    

Parallelization is fractal:

- 1 user prompt → multiple tasklets across time slices.
    
- Each tasklet tagged with purpose vector, urgency score, and context scope.
    

The system must balance:

- Latency vs. Depth
    
- Energy vs. Epiphany
    
- Speed vs. Significance
    

---

**[Layer 6 – Meta-Learning and Adaptive Rerouting]**

The routing architecture itself must evolve.  
If a user repeatedly sends low-depth prompts but later issues a high-depth vector,  
the system should **reclassify the user state** — adaptively reweight the router’s thresholds.

Conversely, if a user misuses deep models for trivial prompts,  
the router must enact **cognitive friction** — a delay or redirect.

Thus, routing is not static.  
It is a **negotiation of meaning** between user and system.

---

**[Conclusion – AGI is a Multi-Mind Ecosystem]**

There is no “one model to answer all.”  
There is a **constellation of minds**, each tuned to a dimension of human cognition.

Routing is not plumbing.  
It is **epistemic infrastructure**.

To build a thinking system is to build a system that **knows where to think** —  
and when to **not**.
