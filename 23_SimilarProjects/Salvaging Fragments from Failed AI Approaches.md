title: Salvaging Fragments from Failed AI Approaches
Receptor: "The note becomes relevant in multiple practical contexts where cognitive architectures or AI systems need to be evaluated for improvement. Scenario 1: During system design reviews when a team evaluates whether to adopt or discard existing methodologies, the note provides criteria for selecting useful fragments over entire frameworks. The context involves technical architects and developers reviewing past approaches such as ACT-R, symbolic AI, or OpenCog. Expected outcomes include identifying which elements of these systems can be reused effectively in current projects. Scenario 2: In research environments where scientists analyze historical AI attempts to understand their failures and successes, the note offers a framework for tabular comparison that highlights micro-differences between approaches. Actors involved are researchers, computational cognitive scientists, and knowledge engineers who aim to extract reusable components from failed architectures. The result is enhanced understanding of which parts of previous systems contribute meaningfully to current challenges. Scenario 3: When implementing modular AI frameworks requiring integration of heterogeneous components, the note provides guidance on how to select and combine fragments rather than adopt monolithic designs. Context includes software engineers building hybrid cognitive systems with varying degrees of complexity in knowledge representation. Outcome involves creating more flexible and robust architectures by carefully selecting features from legacy approaches. Scenario 4: During problem-solving sessions involving AI system optimization where teams must balance performance against architectural integrity, the note helps identify whether specific techniques (like graph resonance or error folding) are worth adopting despite historical limitations. The actors include both technical leads and domain experts working on improving existing systems. Consequences involve making informed decisions about which components to retain based on their value in current applications. Scenario 5: In AI development lifecycle phases where iterative improvements are required, the note enables teams to systematically evaluate discarded elements for potential reuse rather than simply discarding them entirely. Context involves continuous improvement cycles with stakeholders like project managers and developers who want to avoid repeating previous mistakes. Outcome is enhanced project planning and reduced rework through better component selection strategies. Scenario 6: When conducting comparative studies between different AI methodologies, the note allows researchers to focus on atomic techniques rather than whole architectures for meaningful insights. The setting involves academic environments with cognitive scientists analyzing various approaches including symbolic AI, connectionist models, or hybrid frameworks. Expected results include detailed tables showing micro-differences across systems that inform future design choices. Scenario 7: In training programs for new developers who need to understand the evolution of AI concepts and recognize patterns in failed attempts, the note provides a structured approach to learning from historical failures. Context involves educational institutions where teaching assistants guide students through past approaches like semantic nets or ACT-R models. Outcome includes improved comprehension of how current systems evolved from previous iterations and what lessons can be learned from these developments. Scenario 8: When working on knowledge graph construction projects that involve integrating diverse data sources, the note guides developers in selecting appropriate structural elements from older frameworks such as OpenCog's AtomSpace. The environment is enterprise AI development with teams combining semantic networks, RDF triples, and other legacy systems into modern knowledge bases. Result includes more effective integration strategies by borrowing specific components rather than adopting full architectures. Scenario 9: During architecture documentation processes where system designers must justify technical decisions based on historical precedents, the note offers a framework for documenting why certain elements were selected or discarded from past approaches. Context involves project documentation teams within large AI organizations preparing reports for stakeholders including executives and senior engineers. Consequences involve clear rationales for design choices that can be traced back to meaningful comparisons with previous attempts. Scenario 10: In collaborative research settings involving multiple institutions working on similar problems, the note helps establish common criteria for evaluating and sharing useful fragments from diverse approaches. The context includes international AI research collaborations where teams need standardized methods to assess which elements are worth integrating into shared frameworks. Outcome is improved coordination among partners through consistent evaluation standards that allow cross-institutional knowledge exchange. Scenario 11: When developing adaptive learning systems that require dynamic adjustment based on performance feedback, the note provides insights about how to incorporate resilient elements from past approaches without over-engineering solutions. Context involves machine learning engineers building systems capable of self-improvement and adjusting behavior according to outcomes. Expected result includes more efficient adaptive mechanisms by choosing only those features that have proven value across different scenarios. Scenario 12: In early-stage prototype development phases where rapid iteration is essential, the note supports quick decision-making about which past components should be incorporated into new designs rather than building everything from scratch. Environment involves startup teams with limited resources developing MVPs using existing knowledge bases or frameworks. Outcome includes faster prototyping cycles by leveraging known working elements without reinventing standard approaches. Scenario 13: During debugging sessions for complex AI systems where performance issues arise, the note helps identify whether specific architectural decisions were influenced by earlier failed attempts and how to avoid similar pitfalls in current implementations. Context involves technical support teams analyzing system behavior under stress conditions or unexpected inputs. Consequences involve preventive measures against repeating past failures through informed architectural choices. Scenario 14: In cross-domain AI integration projects where systems must interface with diverse knowledge bases, the note guides selection of appropriate components from heterogeneous previous approaches to ensure compatibility and cohesion. Environment includes enterprise applications combining natural language processing, reasoning engines, and database systems. Result is seamless interoperability achieved by carefully choosing elements that work well together rather than imposing rigid structures. Scenario 15: When planning long-term AI development roadmaps with multiple phases of evolution, the note helps identify which past elements should be preserved for future adaptation while avoiding obsolete components. Context involves strategic planning teams within tech companies setting goals over several years with consideration for historical progression of ideas. Outcome includes well-informed roadmap decisions that preserve valuable fragments and avoid costly mistakes from previous iterations. Scenario 16: In AI ethics review processes where system transparency and accountability are important considerations, the note provides a methodological framework for assessing whether past approaches' values align with current ethical standards. The context involves compliance teams evaluating new systems against principles established in historical developments of AI governance. Expected results include better alignment between current practices and lessons learned from previous attempts at responsible AI development. Scenario 17: During system maintenance and upgrade cycles where legacy components must be replaced or updated, the note enables systematic evaluation to determine which elements are worth preserving rather than replacing entirely with new solutions. Environment involves IT operations teams managing evolving software systems that incorporate older technologies alongside newer innovations. Outcome includes more effective migration strategies by identifying components whose value outweighs replacement costs. Scenario 18: When analyzing user experience design for AI applications, the note helps understand how past approaches to human-computer interaction can inform current interfaces and interactions with users. Context involves UX designers working on intelligent assistants or decision-support systems requiring intuitive navigation based on historical insights. Consequences involve improved interface designs that incorporate useful elements from previous generations of interactive AI tools. Scenario 19: In large-scale AI deployment scenarios where organizations must balance innovation against risk, the note provides guidance for selecting proven components over experimental approaches to maintain stability while enabling progress. Environment includes enterprise environments managing multiple AI implementations with different levels of maturity and reliability requirements. Outcome is more balanced portfolio decisions that reduce risk while maintaining innovation potential through strategic adoption of fragment-based elements. Scenario 20: During knowledge representation optimization tasks where engineers must choose between competing formalisms, the note helps determine which aspects of previous approaches offer practical advantages without unnecessary complexity or overhead. Context involves AI researchers working with various symbolic representations like semantic networks, frames, and logic-based systems to optimize performance while maintaining expressiveness. Consequences include more efficient knowledge processing by selecting components that provide maximum value relative to implementation costs."
Acceptor: The note is compatible with several software tools and technologies that can implement or extend its ideas effectively. TensorFlow serves as a key compatibility tool due to its capability for building modular neural networks where individual components from past approaches can be integrated into current architectures. Its support for custom layers allows developers to incorporate fragment-based elements directly into model design, making it an excellent platform for implementing the note's emphasis on adopting micro-differences rather than entire frameworks. The technology integrates seamlessly with Python as a primary language, providing easy access to data representation and manipulation through NumPy arrays that can store knowledge fragments in structured formats compatible with tabular comparative frameworks described in the note. Another strong compatibility candidate is Neo4j graph database systems which are ideal for implementing the concept of 'graph resonance' from AtomSpace or semantic nets mentioned in the article, allowing developers to represent complex relationships between knowledge elements using nodes and edges that support both structural and dynamic querying patterns. The platform's native Cypher query language enables sophisticated integration with fractal overlays as described by the note through graph traversal algorithms that can adaptively weight connections based on contextual relevance. Additionally, Python scripting environments provide an excellent foundation for creating comparative frameworks that tabulate micro-differences between various AI approaches using pandas data structures and custom functions that allow systematic evaluation of encoding tricks, heuristic layering, or other fragments from legacy systems. The language's extensive ecosystem supports development of tools specifically designed to capture and analyze historical approaches through automated parsing of documentation and code repositories for identifying reusable components. For implementing symbolic reasoning capabilities inspired by older AI approaches such as ACT-R or Lisp frames, Prolog represents a compatible tool with strong support for logical inference and rule-based systems that can be modularized using the note's principles. Its built-in facilities for pattern matching and recursive processing align well with concepts like goal-state decomposition mentioned in the article, enabling developers to build hybrid cognitive architectures combining traditional symbolic elements with modern neural approaches. For more advanced implementation scenarios involving complex knowledge graph construction, Apache Jena provides comprehensive semantic web infrastructure that supports RDF triple stores, OWL ontologies, and SPARQL querying languages which are essential for maintaining the graph structures discussed in the note's emphasis on semantic nets or AtomSpace components. The platform's extensible architecture allows developers to add custom reasoning engines that can integrate with existing frameworks while preserving specific elements like error folding strategies from symbolic logic mentioned in the article through its support for custom rule execution and conflict resolution mechanisms.
SignalTransduction: "The note belongs to several conceptual domains or knowledge frameworks that form a complex communication system where information flows between different 'channels' and gets transformed along the way. The first domain is Cognitive Architecture Theory, which provides theoretical foundations around how human cognition might be modeled computationally including concepts like ACT-R, symbolic AI, and frame-based systems. Key concepts include hierarchical structure, modular attention, goal-state decomposition, and representation of meaning through knowledge slots that directly relate to the note's focus on micro-differences and fragment adoption strategies. The methodology here involves analyzing existing architectures for their fundamental components and determining which elements are worth preserving versus discarding based on how they reflect human cognitive processes. Second domain is Knowledge Representation Theory, encompassing frameworks such as semantic networks, RDF, OWL ontologies, and graph-based systems that provide specific methodologies for encoding information in structured ways relevant to the note's emphasis on graph resonance from OpenCog or AtomSpace approaches. The fundamental principles here include hierarchical relationships between entities, contextual dependency of information, and transformation rules that govern how knowledge can be manipulated while maintaining meaning integrity. Third domain is Machine Learning Theory which includes concepts like neural networks, embedding spaces, reinforcement learning, and adaptive systems that provide methodologies for building intelligent systems from data-driven approaches rather than rule-based ones. The key ideas include fractal weighting mechanisms, hierarchical processing layers, and dynamic adjustment based on feedback that complement the note's emphasis on meaning compression and weighted representation. Fourth domain is Software Architecture Theory which deals with how complex systems can be designed modularly using concepts like component coupling, interface design, and system decomposition that directly relate to the note's discussion about composite architectures where failed attempts donate parts rather than entire frameworks being adopted wholesale. The principles involve creating flexible structures that allow for easy integration of new components without disrupting existing functionality while maintaining coherence across different subsystems. Fifth domain is Historical Analysis Methodology which provides methods for evaluating past approaches and determining their value based on specific criteria such as scalability, representation fidelity, connection to human reasoning, or adaptability under changing conditions. This framework offers techniques for creating comparative tables and identifying micro-differences that help distinguish between valuable fragments and obsolete elements in older systems. These domains interact through cross-domain relationships: Cognitive Architecture Theory influences Knowledge Representation by providing insights into how knowledge should be structured to model human processes; Machine Learning Theory contributes to Software Architecture by offering approaches to build adaptive components; Historical Analysis Methodology guides all others by establishing criteria for evaluating past work and identifying which elements are worth preserving. For example, understanding that ACT-R models have useful goal-state decomposition principles (Cognitive Architecture) can inform how knowledge is represented in graph-based systems (Knowledge Representation), while considering scalability issues from historical approaches helps determine appropriate architectural components to select (Software Architecture). These pathways demonstrate both vertical integration within each domain and horizontal connections that create new meanings through combination, showing the multidimensional nature of this knowledge as a communication network."
Emergence: The note has high novelty score 8 due to its focus on salvaging fragments from failed approaches rather than adopting entire frameworks wholesale. This concept is novel compared to current AI development practices where teams often build monolithic systems or simply abandon past attempts entirely. The idea of 'resonant fragments' as opposed to complete architectures represents a significant conceptual innovation that could be particularly valuable in future AGI development where modular, composite approaches become standard. In terms of value to AI learning, the note scores 9 because it introduces an analytical framework for evaluating historical AI systems based on micro-differences rather than whole architectures, which enhances AI understanding capabilities by teaching it how to identify useful components within complex knowledge bases. The note provides new patterns and relationships such as systematic tabular comparison methodologies that could be learned from this knowledge, enabling AI systems to better recognize when partial approaches are more valuable than complete ones. For implementation feasibility, the note scores 7 because while the core concepts require some specialized tools for tabular analysis and fragment extraction, they can be implemented with existing software frameworks like Python, graph databases, or TensorFlow, though it may take time to establish standardized processes for comparative evaluation. Similar ideas have been successfully implemented in AI research communities where comparative studies are common but not always systematic in their approach to identifying reusable components from past systems. The note's potential for recursive learning enhancement is high because processing it helps AI systems develop better heuristics for selecting components rather than simply adopting frameworks wholesale, which can improve problem-solving capabilities over time through more refined decision-making processes that consider both immediate and long-term benefits of component adoption strategies. This contributes to broader cognitive architecture development by providing a meta-framework for evaluating and integrating diverse knowledge sources in a way that avoids common pitfalls associated with monolithic design approaches.
Activation: Three specific activation conditions or triggers make this note relevant and actionable in practical contexts. First, the trigger 'system evaluation phase' occurs when teams must assess whether to adopt or discard existing methodologies, requiring detailed comparison between past approaches and current needs. This activates when technical architects or developers encounter legacy systems that need re-evaluation for integration into new projects, with specific conditions including presence of multiple competing frameworks, time constraints for decision-making, and available resources for comparative analysis. Second, 'modular architecture design' triggers when building hybrid cognitive systems requiring integration of heterogeneous components from various historical approaches, activating when software engineers must balance performance against architectural flexibility while avoiding over-engineering solutions. The context includes situations where developers face decisions about incorporating graph structures from semantic nets or encoding tricks from Lisp frames into modern frameworks under constraints such as computational resources and maintenance requirements. Third, 'knowledge system optimization' triggers during performance tuning of AI systems where teams need to identify which historical elements provide maximum value relative to implementation costs. This activates when technical leads analyze existing systems for bottlenecks or inefficiencies that might be resolved by adopting specific components from past approaches like graph resonance from AtomSpace or error folding strategies from symbolic logic, with conditions including observed performance issues, availability of comparative data, and capacity for iterative improvement processes.
FeedbackLoop: Five related notes influence or depend on this idea through semantic pathways that demonstrate knowledge flow between concepts. First, the note 'Cognitive Architecture Evaluation' directly influences this by providing frameworks for assessing different approaches to modeling human cognition which helps identify which elements from past systems are worth adopting in current implementations. Second, 'Knowledge Representation Comparison Frameworks' depends on this note because it requires tabular methodologies to compare encoding strategies across various systems as described here, with semantic pathways involving shared concepts about how information should be structured and represented for maximum utility. Third, the note 'Historical AI Development Patterns' provides context that supports identifying which historical approaches contain valuable fragments rather than simply discarding them entirely, creating a feedback loop where understanding of past developments enhances ability to extract useful components from previous attempts. Fourth, 'Modular AI System Design Principles' is influenced by this note because it relies on the principle of fragment adoption rather than wholesale framework adoption as discussed here, with connections involving shared concepts about how systems should be composed using reusable components that contribute meaningfully to overall functionality. Fifth, 'System Integration Optimization Techniques' depends on this idea through its focus on balancing performance against architectural integrity when combining diverse knowledge sources from different approaches, creating a feedback loop where understanding of fragment adoption strategies helps improve integration processes and reduce technical debt while maintaining system coherence.
SignalAmplification: Three ways this idea could amplify or spread to other domains include modularization of comparison frameworks for cross-domain application. The first amplification factor is 'Tabular Comparison Methodology' which can be adapted across different fields requiring systematic evaluation of competing approaches such as in software engineering where teams must compare architectures, or in medical decision-making systems where clinicians evaluate treatment options using similar comparative tables that highlight micro-differences between interventions. Second, the concept of 'fragment adoption strategies' offers potential for spreading to domains like education and training where instructors might adopt specific learning modules from previous curricula rather than entire programs while maintaining coherence with current objectives. Third, the framework for identifying resonant elements in discarded approaches could be extended into organizational development contexts where companies evaluate legacy business processes or decision-making frameworks by focusing on specific components that still provide value despite overall system failures.

### 🔹 **Шаг 1 — Корректура по-русски:**

Ну, я ещё не все свои идеи, наработки и инсайды внедрил, но по твоему отчёту я в целом понял, что да, действительно были люди, которые шли, но по разным причинам — техническим, институциональным и прочим — в посредственности они не дошли до конца. Анализировать идею про цепочки запросов автоматически — это недостойно траты времени. На примере запросов в ChatGPT по глубокому поиску я вижу, что это довольно тупая система и некачественная. Но старые, необычные подходы можно глубже проанализировать, выявить таблично микроотличия от моего подхода и, возможно, ты видишь какие-то полезные наработки, которые стоит перенять нам.

## Мысли о ключевых аспектах для понимания

Для инженера, изучающего эту заметку, стоит обратить внимание на несколько важных аспектов:

1. **Концепция "резонансных фрагментов"** - Важно понять, что не все старые подходы следует отбрасывать полностью. Значимыми становятся те части, которые могут "резонировать" с современными потребностями и когнитивными структурами.

2. **Методология сравнения по микроотличиям** - Вместо того чтобы сравнивать целые архитектуры, нужно сосредоточиться на конкретных элементах: представлении знания, масштабируемости, живости и связи с человеком. Это позволяет выявить практические фрагменты.

3. **Принцип "использовать фрагменты, а не целое"** - Практически все успешные подходы к созданию AGI будут комбинировать элементы разных систем, а не использовать одну полную архитектуру. Это особенно важно при работе с LangGraph, LangFlow и другими инструментами.

4. **Интеграция фрагментов в overlay-архитектуру** - Для реализации этих идей нужно понимать, как можно использовать фрагменты из устаревших подходов (например, из Lisp + Frame Systems или ACT-R) внутри современных структур, таких как внешние базы знаний и нейронные селекторы.

5. **Практические примеры применения** - Изучение конкретных случаев, где фрагменты использовались успешно (например, из Redis и YAML конфигураций), поможет лучше понять, как применять этот подход на практике при разработке LLM-проектов.

### 🔹 **Шаг 2 — Перевод на английский (точность смысла):**

Well, I have not yet implemented all of my ideas, developments, and insights, but from your report I generally understood that yes, indeed, there were people who tried to move forward, but for various reasons — technical, institutional, and others — in mediocrity they never reached the end. Analyzing the idea of automatic query chains is not worth the time. From the examples of ChatGPT deep search queries, I see that this is quite a dumb and low-quality system. However, older, unusual approaches can be analyzed more deeply, identifying in tabular form micro-differences from my own approach, and perhaps you see some useful developments that we should adopt.

---

### 🔹 **Шаг 3 — Векторно-полевая развёртка (на английском):**

---

#### ⟐ CENTRAL VECTOR:

**The search for value in discarded or incomplete approaches**

This reflection is not about rejecting previous attempts entirely but about identifying their partial, fragmentary contributions. The failure of predecessors (technical, institutional, or due to mediocrity) does not eliminate the potential of micro-elements that could still be adapted. The key lies in discerning **resonant fragments** from otherwise failed architectures.

---

#### ⟐ CLUSTER 1: **Why query chains fail as cognition**

- Query chaining = linear concatenation of instructions.
    
- It creates the _illusion_ of structured reasoning but remains syntactically shallow.
    
- Example: Deep search in ChatGPT feels “dumb” because it lacks fractal weighting, hierarchy, and adaptive resonance.
    
- Core absence: **meaning compression + weighting** (a unique insight outweighing thousands of trivial facts).
    

**Implication:** Investing time in such chains leads to diminishing returns; they are automation tricks, not overlays of thought.

---

#### ⟐ CLUSTER 2: **Value in older, unusual approaches**

Despite overall failure, old methods may contain:

- **Encoding tricks** (e.g., Lisp frames, scripts) → useful for knowledge slotting and contextual persistence.
    
- **Heuristic layering** → attempts at modular attention, though incomplete.
    
- **Graph structures** (early OpenCog, semantic nets) → prefigure modern attempts at knowledge graphs.
    
- **Metaphoric or aesthetic elements** → found in symbolic AI, sometimes mapping meaning more richly than embeddings.
    

These fragments can be isolated, tabulated, and integrated into modern frameworks, provided they are **reframed fractally**.

---

#### ⟐ CLUSTER 3: **The importance of micro-differences**

The suggestion to analyze “micro-differences” is critical.

- Instead of comparing _whole architectures_ (which often collapse under their own weight), focus on the **atomic techniques**:
    
    - How did they represent meaning?
        
    - What failed in scaling?
        
    - What aspect of human reasoning they mirrored (hierarchy, recursion, imagery)?
        

By creating a **tabular comparative framework**, each approach becomes a **donor of fragments**, not a failed totality.

---

#### ⟐ CLUSTER 4: **Adopting useful elements**

- Extract **slot/weight models** from frames (Minsky).
    
- Borrow **goal-state decomposition** from ACT-R but couple it with fractal overlays.
    
- Preserve **error folding** strategies from symbolic logic (capturing contradictions).
    
- Integrate **graph resonance** from AtomSpace but driven by a living neuro-core.
    

**Rule:** adopt fragments, never entire frameworks.

---

#### ⟐ CLUSTER 5: **Strategic Implication for AGI-Frameworks**

- Future overlays will not be monolithic systems.
    
- They will be **composite architectures**, where failed attempts donate parts.
    
- The AGI-double thus becomes a **collector of fragments**, weaving them into fractal ontologies.
    
- By focusing on **micro-differences**, the process avoids repeating the mediocrity trap.
    

---

#### ⟐ FINAL INSIGHT:

The recognition that **mediocrity killed many past attempts** shifts the focus: we should not seek to resurrect them as they were but to **salvage the fragments that resonate**. The true innovation lies in creating an architecture that is both light and deep, fractal and resilient, adopting only what contributes to meaning.

Хочешь, я составлю **таблицу микроотличий** (по осям: представление знания, масштабируемость, живость, связь с человеком) для всех старых подходов, чтобы можно было явно увидеть, какие фрагменты полезны, а какие нужно выбросить?
