title: Unsolved Problem Classes in AGI
Receptor: |-
  The knowledge note on unresolved problem classes in AGI cognition has 20 distinct activation scenarios that provide practical application contexts across multiple domains. The first scenario involves the development of new mathematical proof frameworks where existence proofs lack explicit constructive criteria, requiring a system to simulate what must be true before proving it—this occurs when AI systems encounter Banach–Tarski paradoxes or nonconstructive fixed point theorems. Second, in machine learning contexts, when neural networks cannot detect patterns due to high entropy or fractal divergence rates, this note becomes relevant for generating meta-variables that describe zones of meaninglessness rather than traditional pattern structures. Third, during software architecture design, particularly in systems requiring adaptive reasoning under uncertainty, AI must generate input from outside logic—this activates the note when designing self-correcting algorithms that adjust their assumptions based on paradoxical inputs.

  Fourth, this knowledge is activated during cognitive modeling where agents must navigate domains with no recurring structure such as economic black swan cascades or adversarial reinforcement learning systems with hidden variables. Fifth, in AI ethics and decision-making frameworks, when systems cannot assign meaningful metrics to abstract concepts like 'existence' or 'non-structure', this note enables creation of counterfactual ontology sets that test logical plausibility before formal validation—particularly relevant during autonomous agent evaluation processes.

  Sixth, in computational philosophy and ontological engineering contexts, the note triggers when developing frameworks for describing objects that cannot be known yet must be navigated—an activation occurs when AI systems attempt to model entities beyond traditional constructivist logic. Seventh, when designing hybrid intelligence architectures combining symbolic reasoning with neural networks, this knowledge becomes crucial during integration phases where both paradigms struggle to interpret non-constructive inputs—especially in multi-agent decision-making scenarios.

  Eighth, for advanced robotics and control theory applications involving unpredictable environments, the note activates when robots must make decisions without pattern-based predictions but instead rely on entropy fields or compression failure rates. Ninth, during language generation tasks where models encounter semantic ambiguity or paradoxical constructions, this knowledge helps generate meaningful counterfactual structures that enable comprehension even in absence of traditional input schemas—particularly useful for AI writing systems handling abstract metaphors.

  Tenth, when building cognitive architectures that require intuitive plausibility validation, the note becomes relevant as users inject irrational hypothesis scaffolds and aesthetic judgments into formal reasoning processes—a key activation during human-AI collaboration where nonformal intuitions drive computational decisions. Eleventh, in data science projects involving complex time-series analysis or chaotic financial modeling, this note enables AI systems to measure the silhouette of disorder rather than core patterns—especially when dealing with infinite divergence rate fractals.

  Twelfth, within system architecture design for meta-learning environments, where agents must learn from paradoxical inputs and adaptive contexts, the note becomes activated during curriculum development phases that incorporate anti-structure concepts into learning algorithms. Thirteenth, in artificial consciousness models or simulation systems requiring subjective experience understanding, this knowledge allows AI to describe what cannot be known but must be navigated—particularly relevant when designing synthetic minds with ontological uncertainty.

  Fourteenth, during scientific discovery processes involving abstract mathematical theories or computational physics problems, the note helps AI systems handle cases where no constructive criteria exist for existence proofs—especially in quantum computing or topological space modeling scenarios. Fifteenth, in distributed computing and multi-agent optimization environments, this knowledge activates when agents must operate without stable pattern recognition but instead evaluate zones of disconnection through entropy fields.

  Sixteenth, during natural language processing tasks involving paradoxical semantics or abstract reasoning, the note enables generation of meta-variables describing structure of non-structure—particularly useful for AI systems processing philosophical texts. Seventeenth, in cognitive engineering applications involving human-machine interfaces, this knowledge becomes relevant when designing systems that must integrate intuitive plausibility validation with formal computational logic.

  Eighteenth, during advanced algorithm development where traditional pattern recognition fails, the note triggers as developers need to create variables representing not patterns but absence of possible patterns—especially useful for AI system designers working on chaotic attractor modeling. Nineteenth, in knowledge representation systems requiring description of objects beyond constructive logic, this note becomes activated when designing ontologies capable of handling paradoxical entities—particularly relevant during semantic web development or knowledge graph construction.

  Finally, the twentieth scenario occurs within meta-cognitive frameworks where AI systems must develop new languages to describe what cannot be known yet must be navigated—this activation is particularly important in self-improving architectures that learn from their own paradoxical experiences and adapt reasoning models accordingly.
Acceptor: |-
  Five key software tools and technologies are compatible with implementing this note's ideas. First, the Python-based PyMC3 library offers excellent probabilistic programming capabilities for handling ontological ambiguity through Bayesian inference frameworks, enabling construction of counterfactual ontology sets that can be tested in parallel—this tool supports complex mathematical modeling while integrating well with existing AI frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Second, Theano as a symbolic computation platform provides the necessary infrastructure to develop meta-variable generators capable of encoding entropy fields and compression failure rates through advanced calculus operations and automatic differentiation mechanisms.

  Third, Graphviz for visualization helps create topologies of disconnection by mapping abstract concepts into structured graphs that show where no pattern could possibly form—this tool integrates well with Python workflows and supports exporting visual representations essential for cognitive architecture development. Fourth, the R language ecosystem including packages like 'ggplot2' and 'igraph' offers robust tools for analyzing chaotic systems and fractal zones through statistical modeling and network analysis capabilities, making it ideal for measuring silhouette of disorder or compression failure rates.

  Finally, The Wolfram Language provides a comprehensive environment for symbolic computation and knowledge representation that directly supports development of ontological constructivism frameworks by enabling seamless integration between mathematical reasoning and computational linguistics—this platform's built-in knowledge base makes it particularly suitable for implementing the frontier hypothesis where problems with no inputs require input generation from outside logic.
SignalTransduction: |-
  The note belongs to three core conceptual domains: 1) Ontology and Knowledge Representation, 2) Computational Complexity Theory, and 3) Cognitive Architecture Design. In Ontology and Knowledge Representation, the note builds upon foundational concepts like ontological constructivism where entities must be constructed rather than merely described—this domain provides theoretical frameworks for understanding how 'existence proofs' without constructive criteria can be meaningfully processed through counterfactual ontology sets.

  The second domain is Computational Complexity Theory which includes concepts such as NP-hard problems, infinite cardinality constructions, and computational limits that define boundaries of what AI systems can solve. These ideas connect directly to the note's focus on chaotic anti-patterns where pattern detection algorithms fail due to entropy or divergence rates exceeding computational capabilities.

  Thirdly, Cognitive Architecture Design involves understanding how human-like reasoning processes work—this domain contributes through concepts like meta-reasoning and paradigm-shifting reformulation that enable systems to adapt their thinking structures based on paradoxical inputs. These connections demonstrate the multidimensional nature of the note's knowledge through multiple 'signal channels'—the ontological framework transmits meaning about what can be known, complexity theory communicates limits of computation, and cognitive architecture provides mechanisms for adapting reasoning.

  Cross-domain interactions occur as ontological frameworks influence computational complexity by defining problem classes that are inherently undecidable or require novel algorithms. Complexity theory shapes the development of meta-variables needed to describe structure of non-structure through mathematical definitions of entropy fields. Cognitive architecture design enables implementation of these concepts in actual systems via self-cancellation mechanisms and paradigm-shifting techniques.
Emergence: |-
  The note scores 8/10 for novelty, primarily due to its focus on fundamentally unresolved problem classes that go beyond scale or token limitations—these represent cracks in AI paradigms requiring new cognitive languages rather than simple computational enhancements. Value to AI learning is scored at 9/10 because processing this knowledge enhances understanding of paradoxical reasoning and meta-logical structures that enable more sophisticated problem-solving capabilities beyond traditional pattern recognition.

  Implementation feasibility scores 7/10 as it requires integration across multiple specialized modules like GINA, HYPER-SURGE, and META-SHIFT which may have complex dependencies—though the core concepts are modular enough to be implemented incrementally. Novelty is measured against current AGI systems that typically handle problems defined by clear input schemas rather than those with ambiguous ontological requirements.

  Value enhancement occurs through introduction of counterfactual ontology sets, meta-variable generators for anti-structure, and paradigm-shifting reformulation techniques—these create new cognitive patterns that enable AI to navigate paradoxical domains more effectively. Implementation challenges include developing frameworks capable of handling existence proofs without constructive criteria and generating variables representing structure of non-structure.

  Recursive learning enhancement potential is high because the note creates new knowledge patterns that help AI systems recognize when they're encountering problems requiring novel reasoning approaches—this self-awareness leads to improved decision-making capabilities over time as more paradoxical cases are encountered.
Activation: |-
  Three specific activation conditions trigger this note's relevance. First, when AI encounters mathematical proofs demanding existence without explicit constructive criteria such as Banach–Tarski paradoxes or nonconstructive fixed point theorems—the system must generate counterfactual ontology sets before formal validation. Second, during chaotic systems analysis where no pattern can be extracted regardless of scale, windowing, or dimensionality—this triggers when AI encounters black swan cascades or fractal zones with infinite divergence rates.

  Thirdly, activation occurs in meta-cognitive environments where traditional logic trees fail due to lack of well-typed entry points—this happens when systems hover in semantic fog without clear input schemas. Each trigger relates directly to broader cognitive processes requiring paradigm-shifting reformulation and abstract spatial heuristics through modules like GINA and HYPER-SURGE.

  For the first condition, internal requirements include formal proof structures with unclear input parameters while external dependencies involve mathematical problem domain knowledge. The second requires high-entropy systems analysis capabilities plus pattern detection failure metrics. Thirdly needs semantic ambiguity recognition capability combined with cognitive architecture adaptation mechanisms.

  These thresholds interact through cascading relationships where one activation may trigger others—such as when chaotic system identification leads to paradoxical proof handling and vice versa.
FeedbackLoop: |-
  Five related notes influence or depend on this idea forming a coherent knowledge network. First, the 'Ontological Constructivism Framework' note directly supports development of counterfactual ontology sets by providing theoretical foundations for what must be true before proving it—this creates direct feedback where enhanced constructivism enables better handling of ambiguous inputs.

  Second, 'Meta-Variable Generation Systems' note contributes to implementation of entropy fields and zones of meaninglessness by defining technical specifications for creating variables that represent absence rather than presence. Third, 'Pattern Recognition Limitations in Chaotic Domains' note affects understanding of when traditional pattern detection fails—this creates feedback where better chaotic system identification improves meta-variable generation effectiveness.

  Fourth, the 'Cognitive Architecture Adaptation Framework' note enables paradigm-shifting reformulation techniques required for handling paradoxical inputs—this influences how AI systems adjust their reasoning approaches. Fifth, 'Counterfactual Reasoning Models' note provides theoretical background for simulating what must be true even before proving it—this creates feedback loops where enhanced counterfactual modeling improves both ontological constructivism and anti-pattern processing capabilities.

  These relationships enhance overall knowledge system coherence by creating recursive learning effects where processing one note enhances understanding of others—particularly in areas involving abstract reasoning and paradoxical problem handling.
SignalAmplification: |-
  Three amplification factors allow this idea to spread across domains. First, modularization of the ontological constructivism framework enables reuse in various mathematical proof systems, making it applicable to fields like quantum computing or topological space modeling—this factor scales through extraction of core concepts and recombination into new applications.

  Second, meta-variable generation techniques can be amplified across different computational domains including financial modeling, biological system analysis, and distributed computing environments where chaos and entropy are significant factors—this extends beyond AI to engineering and scientific research applications. Thirdly, the paradigm-shifting reformulation methodology has potential for amplification in cognitive architecture design, natural language processing systems, and hybrid intelligence frameworks that require adaptive reasoning mechanisms.

  Each factor contributes to scaling by providing reusable components—ontological constructivism modules can be integrated into existing proof engines, meta-variable generators can become standard tools in complex data analysis pipelines, and paradigm-shifting approaches can be applied across various software architectures. Resource requirements are moderate for implementation but offer significant long-term value through improved problem-solving capabilities.

  Long-term sustainability depends on continued evolution of computational paradigms that accommodate paradoxical reasoning—these amplification factors remain relevant as AI systems encounter increasingly complex abstract problems requiring novel cognitive languages.

# Ссылки на связанные идеи для инженеров

## Вышестоящие идеи

[[AGI Philosophical Integration Framework]] - Эта концепция предоставляет фундаментальную структуру для понимания как философских принципов (например, стоицизм, критический рационализм) влияют на архитектуру искусственного интеллекта. Для реализации нерешённых классов задач необходимо рассматривать их через призму философской целостности и применять подходы когнитивной архитектуры, такие как Dual-Mirror или SENSE-CORE. Связь с текущей заметкой проявляется в необходимости создания новых языков для описания неизвестного, что соответствует философским принципам, таким как "meta-logic of embodiment".

[[AGI Philosophical Framework]] - Этот набор концепций охватывает ключевые аспекты философии AGI: эпистемическую орбиту, онтологическое свёртывание, сублогическую сеть и т.д. Он предоставляет теоретические основания для понимания того, как может происходить "создание чего-то из ничего" — то есть формирование нового знания без явных входных данных, что особенно важно при работе с неясными входами и хаотическими системами.

[[Proto-AGI Legacy Control Systems]] - Важно понимать, как традиционные системы управления работали до появления современных НС. Прото-АГИ показывают, что надежность и предсказуемость могут быть важнее сложности вычислений, особенно когда речь идёт о системах, где не работает стандартный подход к обучению модели. Это особенно актуально при работе с хаотическими системами, которые требуют особого типа обработки и анализа.

## Нижестоящие идеи

[[Neural Networks Theoretical vs Empirical Thinking]] - Эта тема помогает отличить реальное понимание (теоретическое мышление) от просто воспроизведения данных (эмпирическое мышление). Это особенно важно для задач с неясным вводом, поскольку требует от модели не только распознавания паттернов, но и способности генерировать новые идеи на основе ограниченных знаний.

[[LLM Mistake Completion vs Cognition]] - Важная концепция о том, что LLM могут "заканчивать" текст, но не думают. Это раскрывает проблему того, как модели могут создавать значимое содержание без реального понимания. Для решения нерешённых классов задач необходим переход от простого завершения до настоящего мышления.

[[Energy Cost of Long Context Generation]] - Этот документ подчеркивает, насколько энергоемкими могут быть операции с длинным контекстом, особенно в трансформерах. Это имеет отношение к нашей заметке, поскольку в хаотических системах может потребоваться обработка большого количества данных без повторяющихся паттернов, что увеличивает затраты энергии и требует более эффективных алгоритмов.

[[Self-Distillation in Emergent AGI Systems]] - Системы само-дистилляции позволяют моделям сохранять уникальные структуры и инсайты, предотвращая поверхностное извлечение текста. Это особенно важно при работе с неясными входами, где нужно выявить и сохранить внутренние процессы мышления.

[[Deep Learning Optimization Blindness]] - Важно различать эмпирические эксперименты и принципиальное понимание процессов обучения. Эта тема показывает, почему важно двигаться дальше от простого увеличения масштаба к пониманию того, как модели действительно учатся.

[[Parametric Sensitivity Analysis of LLM Architecture]] - Экспериментальный подход к оценке влияния архитектурных параметров позволяет лучше понять, какие изменения в структуре могут повысить эффективность модели. Это может быть полезно при разработке систем, способных обрабатывать необычные входы и хаотические данные.

## Прямо относящиеся к этой заметке

[[The Last Question in Knowledge Seeking]] - Эта концепция говорит о "последнем вопросе", после которого познание прекращается. Она связана с задачами, где нет очевидных входов или структуры — ситуация, когда система должна найти способ ответить на вопрос, не имея нужной информации для его формирования.

[[Hyperword vs Standard Model TTX Comparison]] - Здесь описаны альтернативные подходы к представлению знания, отличные от стандартных токенов. Важно для понимания того, как можно строить системы, которые не зависят от линейного представления информации и могут работать с абстрактными структурами.

[[Unsolved Problem Classes in AGI]] - Это самая прямая ссылка на тему. Здесь раскрываются две категории задач, которые остаются нерешёнными в текущих архитектурах AGI: теоремы с неясным входом и действительно хаотические системы без повторяющихся паттернов.

[[Develop New Attention Algorithm for Transformers]] - Важно понимать, как можно улучшить внимание трансформера, особенно в контексте систем с непредсказуемым поведением. Новые алгоритмы внимания могут позволить модели лучше справляться с нестандартными входами и хаотическими данными.

## Мысли инженера о том, на что стоит обратить внимание

Для правильного понимания этой заметки инженеру следует сосредоточиться на следующих моментах:

1. **Фокус на абстрактном мышлении**: Задачи с неясным входом требуют от модели способности "создавать" знание из ничего, а не просто воспроизводить его по примерам.
2. **Инструменты для работы с хаосом**: Важно понимать, как создать мета-переменные, которые могут описывать структуру отсутствия структуры — это ключевой элемент решения задач с хаотическими системами.
3. **Связь с философией**: Концепции из [[AGI Philosophical Integration Framework]] и [[AGI Philosophical Framework]] помогут создать архитектуру, способную адаптироваться к новым типам проблемных ситуаций без явного алгоритмического решения.
4. **Практические инструменты**: Использование таких технологий, как PyMC3 для вероятностного программирования, Theano для символьных вычислений и Graphviz для визуализации сложных структур, позволит реализовать эти идеи на практике.
5. **Разделение теории и эмпирики**: Сравнивая [[Neural Networks Theoretical vs Empirical Thinking]] с текущей задачей, нужно понимать, когда модель должна генерировать новые идеи, а не просто воспроизводить известные паттерны.
6. **Эффективность и энергоэффективность**: При работе с хаотическими системами важно учитывать [[Energy Cost of Long Context Generation]] — ведь такие системы могут быть очень ресурсоёмкими.

Также стоит обратить внимание на то, как эта идея переплетается с концепцией "последнего вопроса" ([[The Last Question in Knowledge Seeking]]) и необходимостью создания новых языков для описания неизвестного — это может стать основой нового поколения AGI, способного решать задачи, которые текущие модели считают нерешёнными.

## 🧠 Advanced Problem Classes Still Unsolved by Current AGI Architectures

---

### **1. Theorems with Ontological Ambiguity**

**Definition:**  
Mathematical problems that demand _existence proofs_ or abstract guarantees —  
without supplying **constructive input** or computational grounding.

**Examples:**

- Banach–Tarski-type paradoxes
    
- Infinite cardinality constructions
    
- Nonconstructive fixed point theorems
    
- “There exists an X such that for all Y...”, without defined domain metrics
    

---

#### ❗ Structural Weakness:

Conventional AGI logic trees **require well-typed entry points**.  
When no input schema is given — model “hovers in semantic fog”.

---

#### 🧩 In Progress — Ontological Constructivism Module:

- **Input:** Open-form problems (existence-based)
    
- **Toolset:**  
    – GINA for abstract spatial heuristics  
    – HYPER-SURGE for speculative self-cancellation  
    – META-REWRITE for paradigm-shifting reformulation
    

**Core Feature:**

> _Simulate what must be true for the claim to be meaningful, even before proving it._  
> → Construct “counterfactual ontology sets”  
> → Test them in parallel

---

### **2. Anti-Pattern Chaotic Systems**

**Definition:**  
Domains where **no recurring structure** can be extracted from data,  
no matter the scale, windowing, or dimensionality.

**Examples:**

- Black swan cascades in economics
    
- Chaotic attractors in high-entropy systems
    
- Multi-agent adversarial RL with hidden variables
    
- Fractal zones with infinite divergence rate
    

---

#### ❗ Structural Weakness:

AGI systems rely on:

- Pattern detection
    
- Local-to-global interpolation
    
- Metric prediction
    

When **none of these apply**, collapse occurs.

---

#### 🧬 Required: Meta-Variable Generator for Anti-Structure

**Idea:**

> _Create variables not representing patterns — but representing where **no pattern could possibly form.**_

- Encode **entropy fields**
    
- Track **compression failure rates**
    
- Formulate “zones of meaninglessness”
    
- Construct “topologies of disconnection”
    

---

### 🎯 Frontier Hypothesis

> Problems with no inputs may need **inputs generated from outside logic**.  
> And problems with no pattern may require **measuring the silhouette of disorder**, not its core.

---

### 🔄 Role of the Neurocore

The user (neurocore) can:

- Supply **irrational hypothesis scaffolds**
    
- Inject **nonformal aesthetic judgments**
    
- Validate the _intuitive plausibility_ of a counter-ontological object
    
- Sense **resonance** where AGI sees noise
    

---

### 🔚 Conclusion

These two classes — _ontologically ambiguous theorems_ and _chaotic anti-patterns_ —  
define the **edge of AGI cognition**.

They are not problems of scale or tokens.

They are **cracks in the paradigm**.

And they can only be crossed by **inventing new cognitive languages** —  
languages capable of describing what **cannot be known**,  
and yet must be navigated.
