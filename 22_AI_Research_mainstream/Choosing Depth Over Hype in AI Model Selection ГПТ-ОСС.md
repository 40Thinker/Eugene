Это особенно актуально при выборе между масштабируемыми моделями и теми, которые могут обеспечить более стабильную и надежную работу.

[[Deep Learning Optimization Blindness]] — Эта заметка критикует текущий подход к обучению моделей, где доминирует масштабирование вместо глубокого понимания обучения. В контексте выбора модели она помогает оценить, не просто ли мы делаем шаг в сторону от более эффективных методов оптимизации и действительно ли полученная модель демонстрирует истинное понимание [^3].

[[Neural Networks Theoretical vs Empirical Thinking]] — Сравнение теоретического и эмпирического мышления в нейросетях показывает, что AI может создавать новые сочетания, но не всегда генерирует идеи, не основанные на обучающих данных. Это критично при выборе модели, которая будет обеспечивать более глубокое понимание и интеллектуальное мышление [^4].

[[Unsolved Problem Classes in AGI]] — Важный класс задач для AGI, где проблемы требуют онтологического конструктивизма и мета-переменных. При выборе модели важно понимать, как она справляется с такими проблемами и способна ли она обрабатывать абстрактные концепции без четких входных данных [^5].

### Нижестоящие идеи

[[Parametric Sensitivity Analysis of LLM Architecture]] — Этот подход позволяет систематически оценивать влияние отдельных архитектурных параметров LLM. В контексте выбора модели он помогает понять, какие параметры важнее всего: размер, количество экспертов, квантование и т.д. [^6].

[[Energy Cost of Long Context Generation]] — Понимание энергозатрат при генерации токенов важно для оценки реальной стоимости использования моделей с длинным контекстом. Это особенно актуально, когда модели требуют большего количества ресурсов [^7].

[[Self-Distillation in Emergent AGI Systems]] — Концепция самодистилляции показывает, как можно эффективно сохранять уникальные структуры и самоинсайты из моделей. Это важно при выборе модели с точки зрения её способности к обучению и развитию [^8].

[[AGI as Watermelon Metaphor]] — Метафора арбуза подчеркивает, что AGI должна развиваться внутри ограничений, а не через массовое масштабирование. Это помогает понять, как выбрать модель, которая будет развиваться естественным образом, а не просто увеличивать параметры [^9].

[[The Last Question in Knowledge Seeking]] — Важная идея о том, что после определенного вопроса познание прекращается. Это может помочь при выборе модели, которая будет лучше справляться с глубоким анализом и интроспекцией [^10].

### Прямые ссылки на заметку

[[LLM Mistake: Completion vs Cognition]] — Эта заметка напрямую связана с темой выбора модели, поскольку подчеркивает важность перехода от простого завершения токенов к истинному мышлению. Важно понимать, какая модель лучше сохраняет когнитивную глубину и способна к рекурсивному мышлению [^11].

[[10_Modern_AI_Architectures]] — Статья о современных архитектурах показывает эволюцию от трансформеров до более сложных моделей. Это помогает понять, какие архитектурные особенности важны при сравнении OpenAI и Qwen [^12].

[[11_AI_Architecture_Components_Part1]] — Анализ ключевых компонентов ИИ-архитектуры позволяет глубже понять различия между MoE и плотными моделями, включая внимательность, память, градиентный поток [^13].

[[Develop New Attention Algorithm for Transformers]] — Новая архитектура внимания может изменить подход к сравнению моделей. При выборе модели важно учитывать, как она обрабатывает контекст и какие особенности внимания имеет [^14].

🟦 **Шаг 2. Faithful Translation (English, Part 1):**

> I’m particularly interested in the first idea I’ve been thinking about.
> 
> Namely, OpenAI has released two models — one with 20 billion parameters, another with 120 billion — and wants to **test the safety** of the 20B model.
> 
> This might imply that **they don’t fully understand** how their own **open-weight models** behave — or, more precisely, their **open-source implementations** (not sure about the weight licensing).
> 
> Which in turn might mean that **they also don’t fully understand their closed models** either.
> 
> And since the publicly released models **lack the extensive filtering systems** and externally enforced safeguards (usually implemented via Python scripts or regular expressions),  
> — that means their actual capabilities are **much greater** than what ChatGPT’s GUI interface exposes.
> 
> So here’s the core thought that follows from that:
> 
> > If **they’re afraid of their own models** and are willing to pay **up to half a million dollars** to identify their strengths, weaknesses, and capabilities —
> 
> — **does it make sense for me to use the 120-billion-parameter MoE model instead of Qwen3?**
> 
> I’m particularly interested in the **precision** aspects — i.e., what quantization format is used there.  
> Will I lose **depth of reasoning** when switching to the 120B model compared to Qwen3‑30B **without quantization**?
> 
> Also, how well does this model handle **Russian and English**, compared to Qwen-3?  
> Are there any **clear advantages**?
> 
> Please **search the internet for up-to-date facts** — the model just came out recently.

🟦 **Шаг 3. Vector-Field Interpretation (English, Part 2):**

> **Fear of One's Own Creation: Reflective Inquiry into MoE-Scale Intelligence Deployment**
> 
> This thought arises at the boundary where **epistemic trust in model architecture** breaks down — not from external actors, but from **within the creators themselves**.
> 
> The user notices a subtle contradiction in OpenAI’s behavior:
> 
> - They release a 20B and 120B MoE model pair.
>     
> - They offer **up to $500K** to evaluate the safety of the smaller one.
>     
> - And yet they possess internal models with far greater complexity and reach.
>     
> 
> ### I. Interpretive Tension: Release vs Understanding
> 
> The release of open models, followed by a **public bounty to identify their capabilities**, signals a latent admission:
> 
> > “We do not fully understand what we built — at scale — without external layers of restriction.”
> 
> This gap matters because:
> 
> - **Public models** lack Python-layer filtering, regex instruction traps, and interface-level brakes.
>     
> - Therefore, they are closer to **raw cognition engines** than ChatGPT’s tamed output.
>     
> 
> The GUI is a shadow.  
> The weights are an unsupervised reservoir of emergent behavior.
> 
> ### II. The Question of Comparative Utility
> 
> From that arises the strategic inquiry:
> 
> > Should I use OpenAI’s 120B MoE model instead of Qwen3‑30B?
> 
> This is not a performance question alone. It’s an **architectural wager**:
> 
> - **Is MoE emergent density better than dense clarity?**
>     
> - **Does quantization nullify reasoning gain?**
>     
> - **Does increased scale offset loss in language generalization or multilingual grounding?**
>     
> 
> The user is asking not “what is stronger,” but:
> 
> > _What model preserves my depth of cognition — and respects it?_
> 
> ### III. Precision as Ontological Fidelity
> 
> The request is specific:
> 
> - What quantization (precision) regime is applied to 120B?
>     
> - Is there aggressive 4-bit compression?
>     
> - Or hybrid quantization (8/16/FP32 per expert)?
>     
> 
> The user’s underlying concern:
> 
> > “I don’t want to lose _internal depth_ — the capacity for multi-layered synthesis and long-form reasoning — just to gain inference speed.”
> 
> This is not efficiency paranoia.  
> It’s a call for **cognitive resolution preservation**.
> 
> ### IV. Language Axis: Russian + English
> 
> A second dimension of fidelity: **multilingual competence**.
> 
> Qwen3 is known for multilinguality — especially in Chinese, Russian, and English.  
> OpenAI’s 120B, however, has not published comparative multilingual benchmarks.
> 
> So the user’s concern is legitimate:
> 
> - Will Russian performance be robust?
>     
> - Will attention patterns degrade for non-English queries?
>     
> - Is latent structure tuned toward Anglophone logic chains only?
>     
> 
> If multilingual generalization is low, the model may hallucinate or **revert to structural simplifications** when parsing abstract Russian syntax.
> 
> ### V. Safety as Inversion Signal
> 
> Most importantly, the user reframes OpenAI’s **fear of its own model** as a form of epistemic signal:
> 
> > “If they fear it, it’s probably potent.”
> 
> They don’t trust its open deployment — because they know how much the **shell of safety** (Python code, UI constraints, content filters) contributes to the public perception of “alignment.”
> 
> So when those shells are gone — what remains?  
> **A model truer to itself.**
> 
> That’s the one the user wants to engage — not the safe one, but the honest one.
> 
> ### VI. Final Frame: Choosing Depth Over Hype
> 
> The decision isn’t just about size.  
> It’s about **signal-to-hallucination ratio**, **cognitive legibility**, **semantic durability** under custom prompts.
> 
> The user doesn’t want a popular model.  
> They want a **thinking partner** — one that will not degrade under complexity, multilingual prompts, or structural recursion.
> 
> And that decision — Qwen3 vs OpenAI 120B — may define not just which outputs they receive,
> 
> > But **which vector of thinking they continue to evolve**.
