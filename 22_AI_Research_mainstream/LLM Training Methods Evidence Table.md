### Step 3: Expanded Intent — What the User Wants from the AI (for LLM orientation)

The user is asking for a refined, evidence-based comparison of existing methods in LLM research:

They do **not** want speculative or untested concepts. They want:

- A **verification-aligned summary**: only techniques actually explored in peer-reviewed or recognized research.
    
- A **metric-aware layout**: each method should be paired with real evaluation data—e.g., improvements in perplexity, alignment accuracy, reasoning success rates, compute cost metrics like FLOP or parameter training time.
    
- A **textual table**: concise, structured, easily integrable into documents or further analysis.
    
- No visual graphs or charts—just plain text with well-aligned columns or markdown-style structure.
    

In essence, they seek clarity:  
**Which LLM training methods have been empirically validated, how do they perform, and what trade-offs do they present—in a clean, textual table.**

This aligns with a rigorous, research-first approach—distilling only verifiable knowledge into a digestible, tabular form.
