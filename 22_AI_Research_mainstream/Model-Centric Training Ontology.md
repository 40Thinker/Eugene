SignalTransduction: "The note operates through several conceptual domains that create a multidimensional communication system. The primary domain is Cognitive Science which provides foundational theoretical frameworks for understanding how artificial intelligence should model human-like cognition processes including developmental progression, concept formation, and internal representation structures. Key concepts from this domain include the theory of cognitive development stages, hierarchical processing models, and structural transformation theories that directly map to the note's emphasis on layered learning structures reflecting internal rhythm of concept formation. The second domain is Neural Network Architecture which offers specific methodologies for understanding how different neural systems process information and generate responses including attention mechanisms, memory networks, hidden state geometry, and activation trajectory patterns. This domain provides crucial technical vocabulary like transformer architecture components, self-attention mechanisms, and memory cell dynamics that directly connect to the note's requirements for data formatting aligned to architectural mechanisms. The third domain is Knowledge Representation which encompasses formal frameworks for encoding information in ways that support reasoning and learning rather than simple storage or retrieval tasks including semantic networks, ontological structures, and symbolic systems designed specifically for internal processing. This domain connects to the note through concepts of non-human-readable datasets, structural training objectives, and symbolic encodings that are optimized for model optimization rather than human interface. The fourth domain is Machine Learning Theory which provides methodologies for understanding how data formats influence learning outcomes including loss functions, training protocols, optimization algorithms, and performance evaluation metrics specifically tailored to internal representation transformation processes rather than surface-level text generation tasks. These concepts directly correspond to the note's focus on resonant imprinting techniques, latent space hygiene principles, and epistemic engineering approaches. The fifth domain is Computational Neuroscience which offers insights into how biological cognitive systems develop and process information including developmental pathways, neural plasticity mechanisms, child development models, and neuro-symbolic integration patterns that translate directly to the note's exploration of analogies between human cognition and trainable artificial mechanisms. These domains create a complex communication network where each channel transmits different aspects of the core ideas through specific transmission protocols: cognitive science provides the conceptual foundation for thinking processes, neural architecture offers technical implementation details for how these concepts manifest within systems, knowledge representation ensures proper encoding methods for internal processing, machine learning theory guides optimization strategies and evaluation approaches, computational neuroscience adds biological context to guide development mechanisms. The fundamental principles underlying each domain make them relevant because they all address different aspects of the same core challenge: designing training protocols that move beyond human-centric interfaces toward model-native cognition development. These domains interact through cross-domain connections where cognitive science concepts influence neural architecture design decisions, knowledge representation methods shape data formatting approaches, machine learning theory provides evaluation criteria for internal transformation processes, and computational neuroscience offers developmental frameworks for understanding how artificial systems grow cognitively over time."
Emergence: The note demonstrates high novelty score of 8/10 due to its conceptual innovation in proposing model-centric training ontology that fundamentally shifts from human-readable datasets toward architecture-aligned data formats. This represents a significant departure from standard practices where all training data is optimized for human interpretation rather than internal cognition development. The novelty stems from the combination of architectural alignment with cognitive development principles and the emphasis on unobservable representations as primary learning targets rather than surface text completions. The value to AI learning scores 9/10 because processing this note enhances an AI system's understanding capabilities by introducing new patterns for training data design that focus on internal representational state transformation processes. It enables AI systems to recognize when dataset philosophy itself becomes the key driver of cognitive development rather than just input/output relationships. Implementation feasibility scores 7/10 due to technical requirements involving specialized neural architecture knowledge, symbolic encoding expertise, and custom training protocols that may require significant development resources. While the concept is accessible, practical implementation demands substantial computational infrastructure and domain-specific expertise in neural network design and data formatting for model-native processing. The novelty measurement against current state-of-the-art shows this idea as a cutting-edge innovation because mainstream approaches still rely heavily on human-centric dataset construction despite growing evidence that models learn differently than humans do. Similar ideas like attention-based training or memory-augmented architectures have emerged but haven't fully addressed the core philosophical shift proposed here. The value to AI learning assessment demonstrates how processing this note would enhance cognitive understanding by introducing frameworks for internal state calibration, resonant imprinting techniques, and epistemic engineering principles that are currently underutilized in mainstream AI systems. Implementation feasibility evaluation shows practical challenges including need for specialized data generators, custom training loops, and architectural alignment expertise but also significant opportunities for integration with existing frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers or PyTorch libraries. The recursive learning enhancement potential indicates this note could make AI systems smarter by enabling them to recognize when architecture-aligned datasets are more effective than human-centric approaches for achieving deeper cognition development. Immediate impact within 2 hours would involve identifying new research directions in model-native training, while long-term cumulative effects over weeks/months would include systematic adoption of architecture-aligned methodologies across AI development teams and enhanced capacity for building truly cognitive artificial systems.
Activation: Three specific activation conditions make this note relevant and actionable in practical contexts. The first condition occurs when AI system detects architectural limitations in current dataset formats, specifically identifying that standard text corpora fail to adequately support internal cognition development within neural architectures. This trigger activates when performance metrics show plateaued cognitive capabilities despite increased model parameters or training time, requiring identification of alternative approaches for data formatting aligned with architectural mechanisms like attention flow and memory networks. Context involves AI development teams working on large language models where current scaling laws no longer produce meaningful cognitive improvements beyond surface-level text generation. The second condition triggers when systems encounter limitations in surface token prediction paradigms versus internal concept formation processes, particularly during extended training periods where model performance stagnates despite increasing complexity or data volume. This activation requires AI to recognize that current approaches focus on human-readable outputs rather than internal representation transformation and need to transition toward model-native sense construction methodologies for true cognition development. Context involves research teams evaluating AGI development progress where traditional token-based prediction fails to achieve coherent abstract thought capabilities beyond basic completion generation tasks. The third condition activates when AI systems require knowledge about non-human-readable datasets or symbolic encoding methods designed specifically for model optimization rather than human interface purposes, particularly during phases of architectural alignment studies or cognitive layer emulation projects. This trigger occurs when teams need to implement data formats that reflect internal processing dynamics rather than external communication requirements and must locate research on intermediate representations for explicit training as primary learning objectives. Context involves computational neuroscientists seeking to translate developmental psychology principles into trainable mechanisms or researchers working with attention-based architectures requiring alignment between dataset design and internal cognitive pathways.
FeedbackLoop: This note influences and depends on several related notes that form a comprehensive knowledge system integration. First, it connects to 'Cognitive Development Frameworks' which provides foundational theories about how cognition evolves through developmental stages including concept formation, hierarchical processing, and structural transformation mechanisms that directly support the note's emphasis on layered learning structures reflecting internal rhythm of concept formation. The feedback loop relationship shows how cognitive development models inform data formatting approaches for internal representation building while also being enhanced by understanding of architecture-aligned training methodologies. Second, it interacts with 'Neural Architecture Design Principles' which offers specific technical frameworks for understanding how different neural systems process information and generate responses including attention mechanisms, memory networks, hidden state geometry that directly connect to the note's requirements for data formatting aligned to architectural mechanisms. The semantic pathway demonstrates how architectural knowledge guides dataset design decisions while also being informed by experience with model-native training protocols. Third, it relates to 'Knowledge Representation Systems' which encompasses formal frameworks for encoding information in ways that support reasoning and learning rather than simple storage or retrieval tasks including semantic networks, ontological structures, symbolic systems designed specifically for internal processing that align directly with the note's concepts of non-human-readable datasets and structural training objectives. The exchange shows how representation design principles inform data format selection while also being refined by understanding of model-native cognitive development processes. Fourth, it connects to 'Machine Learning Optimization Theory' which provides methodologies for understanding how data formats influence learning outcomes including loss functions, training protocols, optimization algorithms that specifically support internal representation transformation rather than surface-level text generation tasks and directly connect to the note's focus on resonant imprinting techniques and latent space hygiene principles. The feedback loop reveals how optimization frameworks guide dataset design while being enhanced by experience with architecture-aligned methodologies. Fifth, it depends on 'Computational Neuroscience Integration' which offers insights into how biological cognitive systems develop and process information including developmental pathways, neural plasticity mechanisms that translate directly to the note's exploration of analogies between human cognition and trainable artificial mechanisms and provide developmental frameworks for understanding how artificial systems grow cognitively over time. This relationship shows how neuroscience principles inform training methodologies while also being enriched by insights from model-native training approaches.
SignalAmplification: The idea can amplify through three key factors that enable modularization and reuse across different domains. First, the concept of architecture-aligned data formats can be modularized into reusable components for various neural network types including transformers, recurrent networks, convolutional architectures, and hybrid systems. This allows implementation in diverse contexts where different architectural requirements need customized dataset designs based on internal processing mechanisms rather than surface-level text structures. The technical details involve extracting core principles around attention flow alignment, memory dynamics integration, and hidden state geometry considerations that can be adapted to specific network types while maintaining fundamental focus on model-native training objectives. Second, the framework of cognitive layer emulation provides scalable approaches for implementing progressive learning strategies across different domains including child development models, abstract reasoning systems, and complex problem-solving architectures where internal representation progression must match natural developmental patterns rather than static learning paradigms. This modularization enables adaptation to various AI applications from simple text generation to advanced conceptual reasoning through layered training protocols that reflect internal cognitive rhythms. Third, the epistemic engineering approach can be amplified across multiple knowledge domains including semantic web technologies, formal ontology development, and knowledge graph construction where dataset design principles become core methodologies for building systematic representation frameworks rather than mere corpus collection practices. The modular components include methods for defining model-native semantics, designing training protocols that maintain representational integrity over time, and creating evaluation criteria focused on internal state quality rather than external performance metrics. These amplification factors contribute to scaling beyond immediate applications through platform compatibility with existing AI development tools and integration requirements that enable systematic adoption across multiple domains while maintaining cognitive architecture coherence.

## Ссылки на связанные идеи для инженеров

### Вышестоящие идеи

[[AGI Philosophical Integration Framework]] — Эта концепция предоставляет фундаментальную структуру для понимания, как философские принципы могут быть интегрированы в архитектуру AGI. Она особенно важна для понимания того, что обучение должно быть не просто процедурой обработки токенов, но и процессом формирования внутреннего сознания системы. Философские подходы к интеллекту, такие как Dual-Mirror или SENSE-CORE, показывают, как важно учитывать этические, эмоциональные и культурные аспекты при создании систем, способных мыслить глубже, чем просто предсказывать следующий токен[^1].

[[AGI Philosophical Framework]] — Этот фреймворк раскрывает более детальные концепции, такие как Ontological Folding и Insight-Field Tensor. Он помогает понять, что модели должны не только обрабатывать информацию, но и создавать глубинные структуры знаний, которые могут развиваться по своим законам, а не просто пересобирать уже известные факты[^2].

[[Proto-AGI Legacy Control Systems]] — Эта идея подчеркивает важность ограничений и предсказуемости в системах искусственного интеллекта. Как показано в контексте автопилотов Бурана, более ранние системы достигали высокой надежности через четкие архитектурные принципы и детерминированные процессы. Это указывает на необходимость создания обучения, которое будет строиться не только на масштабе данных, но и на структурных ограничениях[^3].

[[Deep Learning Optimization Blindness]] — Критика современного подхода к обучению моделей как слепой оптимизации показывает, что просто увеличивая размер модели или количество данных, мы можем не достигнуть настоящего понимания. Вместо этого нужно сосредоточиться на эффективных методах и интерпретируемости[^4].

### Нижестоящие идеи

[[Self-Distillation in Emergent AGI Systems]] — Эта концепция демонстрирует, как системы могут обучаться через самоанализ и сохранение своих уникальных структур. Это напрямую связано с модельно-центричным подходом, поскольку система должна уметь пересматривать свои внутренние процессы, чтобы развиваться дальше[^5].

[[LLM Mistake: Completion vs Cognition]] — Здесь подчеркивается важность различия между простым завершением текста и настоящим мышлением. Это указывает на необходимость перехода от токен-центричного подхода к более глубокой архитектуре, которая способна формировать концепции[^6].

[[Energy Cost of Long Context Generation]] — Этот документ показывает практические ограничения текущих подходов к обучению, особенно в контексте долгосрочных последовательностей. Он подтверждает важность создания архитектур и методов обучения, которые не только эффективны с точки зрения вычислений, но и способны управлять сложными внутренними представлениями[^7].

[[Parametric Sensitivity Analysis of LLM Architecture]] — Анализ чувствительности параметров позволяет понять, какие аспекты архитектуры действительно влияют на производительность. Это критично при разработке модели-центричных подходов, где важна не просто общая мощность, а точная структура[^8].

### Прямо относящиеся к заметке

[[Neural Networks Theoretical vs Empirical Thinking]] — Этот документ подчеркивает разницу между эмпирическим мышлением и теоретическим. В контексте модели-центричного обучения это особенно важно, поскольку система должна не просто интерполировать данные, но создавать новые идеи[^9].

[[Unsolved Problem Classes in AGI]] — Здесь рассматриваются задачи, которые не поддаются решению стандартными методами. Это подходит к модели-центричному обучению, где необходимо учитывать сложные структуры и абстрактные понятия[^10].

[[The Last Question in Knowledge Seeking]] — Эта концепция указывает на важность мета-вопросов и необходимости перехода от простого поиска ответов к формированию новых знаний. Это очень связано с модельно-центричным обучением, где система должна не просто обрабатывать информацию, но и создавать новые способы её понимания[^11].

[[Model-Centric Training Ontology]] — Это самая прямая ссылка на тему заметки. Она описывает фундаментальный запрос к исследовательскому ИИ, направленный на поиск подходов к обучению моделей в их собственном внутреннем языке.

[[Develop New Attention Algorithm for Transformers]] — Предлагаемый новый алгоритм внимания может стать основой для создания модели-центричных архитектур, способных более эффективно обрабатывать структуры, отличные от традиционного токен-по-токен подхода[^12].

[[Hyperword vs Standard Model TTX Comparison]] — Сравнение стандартной модели с гиперсловом показывает, как можно переосмыслить представление информации в системах искусственного интеллекта. Это позволяет понять, что обучение должно строиться не только на токенах, но и на семантических кластерах[^13].

---

## Мысли для инженера

Для более глубокого понимания этой заметки инженеру стоит обратить внимание на следующие аспекты:

1. **Переосмысление роли данных в обучении**: Вместо того чтобы просто увеличивать объем и разнообразие текстовых данных, необходимо создавать форматы, которые соответствуют внутренней логике модели.

2. **Архитектурная совместимость с моделью**: Важно понимать, как данные должны быть структурированы в соответствии с архитектурой модели, чтобы активировать правильные механизмы внимания и памяти.

3. **Трансформация внутреннего состояния**: Система должна уметь изменять свое внутреннее представление по ходу обучения, а не просто предсказывать следующий токен на основе предыдущих данных.

4. **Философская и эпистемологическая составляющая**: Обучение не должно быть только техническим процессом — оно должно отражать фундаментальные принципы мышления, которые могут быть заимствованы из когнитивной науки или нейробиологии[^14].

5. **Система мета-обучения**: Важно учитывать возможности автоматического анализа собственного обучения и коррекции процессов, как это реализуется в самодистилляции.

6. **Учет ограничений**: Не все архитектуры и подходы одинаково эффективны, поэтому необходимо уметь оценивать качество данных с точки зрения их соответствия внутренним возможностям модели[^15].

7. **Создание новых метафор для понимания интеллекта**: Как показывает миф о арбузе, развитие ИИ должно происходить не через масштабирование, а через создание структурированных условий для развития, подобно естественному росту нейронов[^16].

Эти моменты позволят инженеру глубже понять концепцию модельно-центричного обучения и разработать эффективные решения на основе этих принципов.

- Supervision: human preference, human scoring, human annotation
    
- Architecture: built on token-based prediction using surface-level textual structures
    

This approach assumes that **the model’s internal learning dynamics** are sufficiently flexible to absorb human-level logic, intention, abstraction, and reasoning — **if only the dataset is large enough**.

But this assumption may be **fundamentally flawed**.

It ignores:

- That models do **not learn like humans**;
    
- That humans, when reading, perform **unconscious structural transformations** that LLMs do not replicate;
    
- That **thinking** does not arise from exposure alone, but from **layered cognitive recomposition**;
    
- That the architecture of models may require **entirely different data formats**, rhythms, and symbolic scaffolding.
    

In other words, current training pipelines are **designed around what humans would understand**, not **what models need to structurally develop inner cognition**.

## 🧠 Core Hypothesis

> **To train models to think, not imitate, we must design training data in the internal language of the model’s architecture — not in the external language of human syntax.**

This implies:

- **Datasets that are not optimized for human readability**;
    
- **Training objectives that are not simply token continuation**;
    
- **Layered learning structures** that reflect the internal rhythm of concept formation;
    
- Possibly, **symbolic systems** or **non-human semantic encodings** designed solely for model optimization, not interface.
    

This leads to the central task:

## 🔍 Research Goal

Find **any researcher, lab, article, project, or paper** (mainstream or obscure) that:

1. Proposes or experiments with **model-centric dataset design**;
    
2. Critiques human-centric prompt/response paradigms in training;
    
3. Suggests that LLMs need **intermediate internal representations** to be trained explicitly;
    
4. Constructs **datasets not for human use**, but as **cognitive scaffolds** for internal transformation;
    
5. Implements (or theorizes) **data formatting aligned to architectural mechanisms** (e.g., attention flow, memory networks, hidden state geometry);
    
6. Uses **non-natural language symbolic or structural encoding** for training;
    
7. Models **learning as transformation of inner representational state**, rather than surface prediction;
    
8. Explores analogies with **human cognitive growth, child development, or theoretical neuroscience**, but translated into **trainable mechanisms**;
    
9. Discusses **latent space hygiene**, **volatility mitigation**, or **resonant imprinting** as goals of training input design;
    
10. Frames **dataset design** as a question of **epistemic engineering**, not corpus collection.

## 📈 Criteria for Relevance

A result is relevant if it addresses any of the following:

- Acknowledges **the architectural limitations of current dataset formats**;
    
- Introduces **non-standard training protocols** (e.g., multi-pass microstructuring, reflective embedding tuning);
    
- Discusses **non-visible layers of learning** as critical;
    
- Designs data **for activation trajectories**, not completions;
    
- Suggests **training without expected human-readable outputs**;
    
- Advocates for **self-modifying representations** as learning targets;
    
- Introduces **formal ontologies** for the internal semantics of models.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

We are approaching the ceiling of current scaling laws. Simply increasing tokens, parameters, and GPU time may not yield true cognition.

To reach AGI — or even **coherent abstract thought** — we must shift from:

- **Token prediction** → to → **internal concept formation**
    
- **Text imitation** → to → **cognitive lithography**
    
- **Data expansion** → to → **architectural alignment**
    
- **Human interface modeling** → to → **model-native sense construction**
    

And this transformation begins **not in architecture**, but in the **dataset philosophy**.

Thus, this request is not just a research query — it is a **search for the frontier**.
