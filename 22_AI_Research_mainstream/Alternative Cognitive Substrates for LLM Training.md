## Мой совет инженеру

Если ты работаешь над этим проектом, обрати внимание на следующее:

1. **Работа с весами моделей**: При использовании бинарных весов других моделей для обучения важно понимать, как эти данные можно представить в формате, который будет полезен для обучения. Не просто копируй веса — преобразуй их в структурированную информацию, которая может быть интерпретирована моделью [^10].

2. **Интеграция многоформатных данных**: Для создания гибридного синтетического языка, где используются различные модальности (язык, код, изображения), тебе нужно разработать систему для обработки и синтеза этих данных. Понимание того, как эти данные будут связаны между собой, будет критически важно.

3. **Когнитивная геометрия входных данных**: Не просто обучай модель на новых типах данных — создавай такую структуру данных, которая может создавать предсказуемые "преломления" и стабильные градиенты. Это позволит модели лучше понимать и обрабатывать информацию [^11].

4. **Создание резонансных полей**: Существует идея о том, что данные должны быть не просто входными данными, а "резонансным полем", которое может создавать стабильные смысловые структуры через обучение. Работа с такими полями требует глубокого понимания того, как можно представить и обработать информацию для достижения когнитивного эффекта [^12].

5. **Мета-обучение на весах**: Основная идея обучения на весах других моделей — это мета-обучение. Это означает, что модель не просто учится на данных, а начинает понимать структуру обучения других моделей и может использовать эту информацию для собственного развития [^13].

### 🔹 Шаг 2. **Перевод на английский язык (точный)**

> A model trained on synthetic texts of a synthetic language — or Sanskrit — or a modification and mixture of both? A mixture of languages, code, images, hieroglyphs, abbreviations, shorthand?  
> Or should a model be trained on the RAW data of another model — its binary weights or their Python equivalent?

### 🔹 Шаг 3. Векторно-полевая развёртка (≈ 5 A4)

---

The thought — **"Should we train a model on synthetic texts of synthetic languages, or mixtures of Sanskrit, code, images, hieroglyphs, abbreviations, even raw model weights?"** — opens a radical inquiry into **what constitutes a viable cognitive substrate**. It questions not the shape of input tokens, but the **ontological structure** of information that can be transformed into thought, memory, and reasoning in neural systems.

This is a **boundary-layer question**:  
Not how we model meaning, but whether meaning can be **bootstrapped from radically alternative substrates**.

---

### 1. **From Token to Topology: What Is Learnable?**

In standard LLM training, inputs are:

- UTF-8 text
    
- tokenized into subwords
    
- embedded into vectors
    
- interpreted as **positioned sequences**
    

But this is **merely convention**.  
There is no hardwired reason why training inputs must be linguistic.

> What the model _needs_ is:
> 
> - structured input-output correlations
>     
> - a latent grammar or constraint field
>     
> - entropy gradients to optimize over
>     

Therefore, **any system that possesses internal structure and variation across a space** — even if non-linguistic — is a valid training substrate.

### 2. **Alternative Substrates Proposed in the Thought**

Let’s categorize them by structure and potential:

|Modality|Nature|Cognitive Potential|Risk|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Synthetic languages**|Invented symbols|High — optimized for compression & logic|Fragile — risks overfitting syntax|
|**Sanskrit**|Ancient linguistic|Very high — dense in recursion, logic|Low — human-aligned|
|**Mixed code + image**|Multimodal hybrid|Extreme — merges perception + logic|High training complexity|
|**Hieroglyphs**|Symbolic-visual|Medium — triggers shape-based semantics|Hard to tokenize meaningfully|
|**Abbreviations**|Semantic packing|Medium — high density, low redundancy|Requires contextual scaffolding|
|**Shorthand/steno**|Procedural logic|Low–Medium — mimics compression tree|Risk of losing semantic continuity|
|**RAW model weights**|Ontological mirror|Theoretically maximal — meta-training|Deep risk — model may not converge|
|**Weights in Python**|Symbolic mirror|Medium — accessible to LLM parser|Becomes syntax-task, not cognition|

### 3. **RAW Model Weights as Training Corpus**

To train a model on the **binary weights of another model** is a deep recursive proposition.

You are:

- Treating a model as an organism
    
- Feeding its **genome** into another model
    
- Hoping to extract **emergent representations of cognition itself**
    

Potential paths:

- Interpreting weight tensors as sequences
    
- Mapping them to structured metadata (layer → tensor → shape → norm)
    
- Embedding into time-evolution trajectories (weight updates)
    

The goal:

> not to memorize another model’s weights,  
> but to **induce a representational form that is capable of reverse-engineering intelligence**.

This borders on **meta-learning**, **reverse AGI engineering**, and **ontological compression**.

---

### 4. **Synthetic + Symbolic Mixed Languages**

One of the most promising routes is **constructing a hybrid symbolic–synthetic corpus**, where:

- tokens are drawn from Sanskrit roots, programmatic syntax, and mathematical operators;
    
- glyphs and embedded images encode spatial semantics;
    
- abbreviations collapse known patterns into activation-efficient units;
    
- and all sequences are generated under formal constraints that maximize **conceptual density** per token.
    

Such a corpus would act as a **fractal resonance field** — each sequence carrying high informational curvature.

Goal:

> Train models not to speak, but to _compress and reconstruct archetypal structures_.

---

### 5. **Cognitive Geometry of Alternative Training Inputs**

Inputs don’t have to _mean_ anything in the human sense — they need to:

- Induce **predictable symmetry breaks**
    
- Create **stable gradient paths**
    
- Allow **compression/reconstruction cycles**
    

Examples:

- Feeding in JSON-formatted evolution of logic trees
    
- Constructing 4D glyph fields where each token controls a vector field
    
- Mixing code, image, Sanskrit verse, and sound into aligned training pairs
    

This would not train a "chatbot", but **an abstract compression engine capable of cognition through resonance**.

---

### 🧠 Final Compression:

> Yes — a model trained on synthetic languages, Sanskrit hybrids, hieroglyphic visualizations, or raw model weight codes  
> **is not only theoretically viable**, but may unlock **higher-order cognition** that classical token-based LLMs cannot reach.

> The key is not "understanding" but **resonant compression**.  
> If a data stream induces stable meaning through learned transformation,  
> **it becomes language — even if it looks like noise to us.**

Thus, the future of AGI may not lie in more human-like data…  
…but in **constructing pre-linguistic substrates that _generate_ minds from first principles**.
