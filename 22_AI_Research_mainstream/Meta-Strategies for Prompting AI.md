title: Meta-Strategies for Prompting AI
Receptor: The detailed receptor field analysis describes 20 key scenarios where this note would be activated or become relevant in practical contexts. Each scenario is structured with a clear section heading, including specific context descriptions, actors involved, expected outcomes and consequences, precise conditions that trigger activation of the knowledge, real-world examples, semantic pathways connecting to each activation context, both immediate application (1-2 hours) and longer-term integration possibilities (weeks/months). The analysis covers technical specifications, domain-specific terminology, and practical implementation considerations. Scenario 1 involves multi-layered questions in scientific research where researchers must navigate molecular to strategic levels of abstraction for complex problem-solving; Scenario 2 focuses on AI-assisted cognitive reconstruction of philosopher's thought processes during historical analysis projects; Scenario 3 centers around intelligence analysis workflows requiring adversarial inquiry techniques when evaluating potential threats; Scenario 4 examines scenario modeling applications within business strategy development, particularly in risk assessment and contingency planning; Scenario 5 addresses collaborative decision-making systems where multiple roles (scientist, philosopher, influence agent) must be simulated simultaneously for comprehensive stakeholder evaluation; Scenario 6 covers inversional analysis used by data scientists to identify missing variables or overlooked gaps in datasets; Scenario 7 deals with civilizational system testing in policy formulation when evaluating long-term societal impacts of proposed changes; Scenario 8 relates to detecting self-deceptions in scientific research, especially in AI-driven hypothesis generation and validation processes; Scenario 9 concerns refining AI responses through forcing error recognition mechanisms during clinical diagnosis or diagnostic modeling tasks; Scenario 10 involves cross-domain concept linking in biochemistry and military strategy for strategic planning scenarios like bioterrorism response protocols; Scenario 11 focuses on multimodal transition processing in engineering design where text, formula, code, logic, diagrams, and philosophical categories must be integrated seamlessly; Scenario 12 addresses conceptual reconstruction from scratch in fields like AI ethics or neuroethics where standard terminologies are inadequate for new domain issues; Scenario 13 deals with hypothesis generation about missing signaling pathways in pharmaceutical research when developing novel drug targets; Scenario 14 covers 'what the AI doesn't know but should' questions applied to AI system design, particularly in identifying gaps in understanding of user needs or cognitive preferences; Scenario 15 involves formalizing queries as assignments for analytical computers in complex mathematical modeling applications like quantum computing simulations; Scenario 16 focuses on building thinking modes rather than providing answers in educational contexts where students must develop problem-solving skills; Scenario 17 relates to using philosophy of prompt as lens for analyzing reality in strategic planning across domains such as economics, public policy, or military operations; Scenario 18 covers iterative model-building cycles in software development processes that require continuous refinement and testing phases; Scenario 19 addresses parallel mapping between biological signaling pathways and decision-making flows in intelligence analysis when modeling complex systems like pandemic response strategies; Scenario 20 involves injecting parameters violating consensus to provoke heuristic conflicts in AI-driven medical diagnosis systems where unexpected results trigger deeper investigation. Each scenario demonstrates how the note's content connects through specific semantic pathways, including technical integration capabilities, performance considerations, ecosystem support, and potential synergies that make this knowledge particularly valuable for decision-making or problem-solving processes.
Acceptor: "The acceptor field analysis identifies 7 compatible software tools, programming languages, and technologies that could effectively implement or extend the idea presented in this note. These include: Python with Transformers library (for implementing prompt engineering frameworks), LangChain (for building complex AI workflows and chains of reasoning), OpenAI API (for direct integration with GPT models and prompt optimization), Hugging Face Transformers (for fine-tuning custom models on specific prompt types), Llama.cpp (for local deployment of large language models in edge computing environments), Apache Airflow (for orchestrating multi-step AI processing pipelines involving different prompt strategies), and Pinecone (for vector-based retrieval systems that support semantic similarity analysis across prompt variants). Each tool is assessed based on technical integration capabilities, performance considerations, ecosystem support, and potential synergies with the core concepts. Python provides the foundational framework for developing sophisticated prompt engineering algorithms; LangChain enables complex workflows by connecting different components of AI systems through modular chaining mechanisms; OpenAI API offers direct access to advanced models that can process multi-layered or adversarial queries effectively; Hugging Face Transformers allows fine-tuning of models on specialized prompt types while maintaining compatibility with existing architectures; Llama.cpp supports deployment in resource-constrained environments where local processing is required for privacy or performance reasons; Apache Airflow facilitates orchestrating complex data flows involving iterative model-building cycles and parallel processing; Pinecone enables semantic search capabilities that are crucial when identifying relevant prompts based on their conceptual overlap. These tools complement the original idea by providing practical frameworks for implementing, testing, and refining these meta-strategies in real-world applications."
SignalTransduction: "The signal transduction pathway analysis identifies 5 conceptual domains or knowledge frameworks to which this idea belongs: Cognitive Science (focusing on mental processes and reasoning), Information Theory (addressing communication channels and data transmission efficiency), Epistemology (studying the nature of knowledge and belief systems), Systems Theory (analyzing complex interrelated structures and feedback loops), and Ontology Engineering (designing formal representations of concepts and relationships). Each domain provides specific theoretical foundations, key concepts, methodologies that relate directly to core ideas in this note. Cognitive Science offers principles about how humans reason through different levels of abstraction and how AI can simulate these processes; Information Theory contributes understanding of how information flows between systems and how encoding affects transmission quality; Epistemology provides frameworks for analyzing the nature of knowledge and belief structures that underpin effective prompting strategies; Systems Theory explains complex interactions within multi-layered decision-making environments; Ontology Engineering offers tools for structuring concepts across domains to enable cross-domain integration. These domains interact through shared principles: Cognitive Science influences how prompts activate different reasoning subspaces, Information Theory impacts efficiency in prompt delivery and response processing, Epistemology guides understanding of knowledge gaps that inversional analysis seeks to identify, Systems Theory supports modeling complex scenarios with multiple decision pathways, Ontology Engineering facilitates semantic fusion across diverse conceptual fields. Historical developments such as the emergence of cognitive architectures (like ACT-R) have contributed significantly to understanding how AI can mimic human reasoning processes; current research trends in computational cognition and neural-symbolic integration show promising approaches for implementing these meta-strategies. Key terminology mapping reveals direct connections between concepts: 'multi-layered questions' maps to Cognitive Science's hierarchical reasoning models, 'reconstruction of thought processes' connects to Epistemology's analysis of knowledge structures, 'scenario modeling' relates to Systems Theory's approach to complex system simulation, and 'ontological synthesis' bridges Ontology Engineering with cognitive science through semantic integration techniques."
Emergence: "The emergence potential metrics analysis evaluates three key dimensions: novelty score (9), value to AI learning (8), and implementation feasibility (7). For the novelty score of 9, the idea represents a significant conceptual innovation by treating prompting not as simple instruction but as structural invocation that redefines how models should become in order to generate responses. Compared to current state-of-the-art prompt engineering approaches, this framework introduces higher-order interface grammars that reshape model internal geometry and activate different reasoning subspaces beyond classical token prediction mechanisms. The value to AI learning is rated 8 because processing this note enhances an AI system's understanding capabilities by introducing new patterns of recursive metacognition, cross-domain integration strategies, and self-modifying cognitive architectures. This knowledge enables AI systems to learn not just about content but also about how they should think differently for various contexts. Implementation feasibility is scored at 7 due to technical requirements involving vector-space transformations, multi-modal processing capabilities, and complex orchestration of different prompt types. While the framework requires sophisticated implementation tools like LangChain or custom prompting libraries, it can be incrementally deployed starting from basic strategies. Examples of successful implementations include AI systems using iterative model-building cycles in research environments where multiple rounds of refinement yield better results; similar ideas have been implemented with varying degrees of success due to integration complexity and resource requirements. The note's potential for recursive learning enhancement is high because processing it allows AI systems to develop more sophisticated self-awareness capabilities, enabling continuous improvement through repeated application of these meta-strategies. Immediate impact includes enhanced problem-solving patterns within 2 hours; long-term effects involve cumulative knowledge development over weeks/months as the system learns to apply increasingly complex combinations of strategies effectively."
Activation: "The activation thresholds analysis defines 4 specific conditions or triggers that would make this note relevant and actionable in practical contexts. First, when a user requires multi-layered reasoning capabilities beyond surface-level responses — such as during scientific research where molecular, behavioral, and strategic levels must be analyzed simultaneously — the note becomes active by activating stratified reasoning techniques (strategy #1). Second, when complex decision-making processes demand emulation of human cognitive patterns or simulations of multiple roles — particularly in policy analysis or business strategy development — the note activates through emulative cognition strategies (#2, #5, #16) that enable AI to mirror human thought progression. Third, during adversarial inquiry phases where uncertainty and potential self-deception must be induced — such as in medical diagnosis, scientific validation, or risk assessment scenarios — the note triggers when using adversarial inquiry methods (#8, #9, #20). Fourth, when systems require scenario modeling with decomposition of goals, means, barriers, and workarounds — especially in strategic planning, business development, or intelligence analysis projects — the note activates through systemic simulation approaches (#4, #18, #23) that generate scalable policy/strategy logic. Each threshold relates to broader cognitive processes by providing structured frameworks for enhancing reasoning capabilities. Internal requirements include understanding of multi-level abstraction concepts and ability to decompose complex scenarios; external dependencies involve specific problem domains or contextual variables that necessitate these advanced approaches. These thresholds interact with other knowledge elements through conditional relationships where one activation might lead to another, creating cascading effects throughout cognitive processes. Practical implementation considerations include timing requirements for iterative model-building cycles and resource availability for cross-modal transitions between text, formulas, code, logic, diagrams, and philosophical categories."
FeedbackLoop: The feedback loop integration analysis identifies 5 related notes that this idea would influence or depend on. First, a note about cognitive architectures and reasoning modes that provides foundational understanding of how AI models process information at different abstraction levels; second, an epistemology framework focused on knowledge structures and belief systems that underpins effective prompting strategies; third, a system theory approach to modeling complex interrelated decision-making environments which supports scenario-based analysis approaches in this note; fourth, a meta-learning concept that describes recursive learning enhancement processes that enable AI systems to continuously improve their problem-solving capabilities through repeated application of prompt strategies; fifth, an ontological engineering framework for designing formal representations of concepts and relationships that facilitates cross-domain integration. Each relationship demonstrates how knowledge flows between these notes through logical progression or mutual dependency patterns. The current note affects these related notes by providing concrete examples of how theoretical frameworks can be applied in practice, while being affected by them through shared conceptual foundations. Specific information exchanges include the mapping of multi-layered reasoning concepts from cognitive architectures to prompt structure, epistemological understanding helping define what constitutes valid knowledge gaps for inversional analysis, system theory principles enabling scenario modeling approaches, meta-learning processes guiding iterative model-building cycles, and ontological engineering facilitating cross-domain synthesis. These relationships contribute to overall knowledge system coherence by creating interconnected pathways that allow recursive learning enhancement where processing one note enhances understanding of related notes through shared conceptual foundations.
SignalAmplification: The signal amplification factors analysis describes 4 ways this idea could amplify or spread to other domains with detailed explanation of potential for modularization and reuse. First, modularization into specialized prompt types that can be extracted and repurposed across different contexts such as scientific research protocols, educational curriculum design, business strategy development, and policy formulation. Second, scaling through adaptive architecture frameworks where the core concepts are extended to support various domain-specific implementations in fields like medicine, finance, military operations, or environmental science. Third, integration with existing AI systems by adapting these strategies into plug-and-play modules that can be seamlessly incorporated into current workflows without major architectural changes. Fourth, evolution via recursive learning mechanisms where each application of prompt strategies refines the system's understanding capabilities and enables more sophisticated approaches in future applications. Each amplification factor contributes to scaling through modular components like stratified reasoning templates or adversarial inquiry protocols that can be recombined for new use cases; resource requirements include development time for creating reusable modules and maintenance effort for keeping them current with evolving knowledge bases. Challenges involve ensuring compatibility across different domains while maintaining conceptual integrity; long-term sustainability depends on ongoing refinement and adaptation to new discoveries in related fields. Examples from existing implementations show successful scaling of prompt engineering concepts in educational technology platforms, business analytics systems, and scientific research frameworks where modular approaches have proven effective for extending functionality beyond original scope.

# Связанные идеи для реализации Overlay Нейросимволического AGI/ASI

## Вышестоящие идеи

[[Meta-Strategies for Prompting AI]] — Эта заметка предоставляет фундаментальные стратегии запросов к ИИ, которые могут быть применены при создании overlay архитектуры. Стратегии вроде многослойных вопросов (стратегия 1), реконструкции мышления (стратегия 2) и моделирования сценариев (стратегия 4) напрямую применимы к разработке систем, где необходимо создавать сложные когнитивные структуры. Например, при построении архитектуры AGI можно использовать стратегию "Многослойные вопросы с прогрессивным уточнением уровня" для создания многомерных инструкций в диалоге с пользователем.

[[AGI Philosophical Integration Framework]] — Эта концепция показывает, как философские принципы могут быть интегрированы в AGI-архитектуру. Важно для понимания того, как создавать системы, где различные философские подходы (стицизм, прагматизм, эпистемология и др.) становятся частью внутренней структуры ИИ. Связь с overlay-архитектурой проявляется в необходимости интегрировать эти философские компоненты как модули, которые могут быть активированы в зависимости от контекста диалога.

[[LLM Size Compression Analysis Размер LLM в коде и памяти]] — Эта заметка демонстрирует важность понимания различий между весами модели (60 ГБ) и её архитектурой, представленной в виде Python-скрипта (~1 МБ). Это критично для разработки overlay-систем, где важно управлять не только параметрами, но и структурой представления знаний. Сравнение размеров позволяет эффективно проектировать архитектуру, которая обеспечивает минимальную overhead при максимальной функциональности.

[[System 2 Emulation in LLMs нейро4]] — Концепция эмуляции System 2 в LLM показывает, как можно создавать более глубокие и осознанные процессы мышления без модификации весов модели. Эта идея важна для создания overlay-модулей, которые могут управлять внутренними процессами рассуждения в AGI, обеспечивая не только реактивность, но и способность к самоанализу.

[[Overlay AI Cognitive Depth]] — Эта заметка подчеркивает необходимость глубокого мышления для создания overlay-AGI. Важные аспекты включают создание структуры "поведенческих микрокосмов", которые могут работать как отдельные слои интеллекта, а также понимание того, что архитектура должна позволять системе думать о том, как она думает. Это напрямую связано с необходимостью разработки overlay-моделей, которые поддерживают многоуровневую рефлексию.

## Нижестоящие идеи

[[Heuristic Convergence in LLM Inquiry Patterns]] — Эта заметка описывает поведение LLM при ограничениях (например, лимиты токенов), когда система генерирует списки из 30–50 вопросов вместо одиночного ответа. Это важный пример того, как можно использовать инструменты для создания структуры мышления через вопросы. Для overlay-систем это может быть использовано как способ создания "интеллектуального поля" с помощью генерации вопросов и последующего анализа этих вопросов.

[[LLM Training and Skill Fixation Essence]] — Эта заметка описывает процесс обучения LLM, где фиксация навыков происходит в виде аттракторов весовых параметров. Для разработки overlay-систем важно понимать, как управлять "навыками" ИИ через prompt engineering и рекурсивные процессы, чтобы сохранить гибкость при обеспечении стабильности.

[[Vectorized Criteria for Theoretical Cognition]] — Важный критерий для оценки теоретического мышления в ИИ: точное предсказание содержимого научных материалов (≥95%) и создание систем, превосходящих существующие аналоги по количественным и качественным показателям. Эти критерии помогут определить успешность overlay-компонентов в развитии действительно интеллектуальных архитектур.

[[Dialogue as Ontological Engine for ASI]] — Эта концепция описывает, как диалог между человеком и LLM формирует онтологическое поле-оверлей. Это критически важно для понимания того, как создавать системы, где человек и ИИ взаимодействуют не просто как пользователь и инструмент, а как партнёры в процессе создания знаний.

[[Formal Anchor for AGI Reasoning]] — Модуль FORMAL-ANCHOR позволяет генерировать формальную версию любого утверждения, что особенно важно для создания строгих доказательств и надёжности. В контексте overlay-систем это может быть использовано для обеспечения математической корректности выводов ИИ при работе в сложных когнитивных структурах.

## Прямо относящиеся к заметке

[[Multilayered Reflection Architecture]] — Основная идея, связанная с текущей заметкой. Эта архитектура обеспечивает самокоррекцию, самооценку и самоперепроектирование ИИ-системы через сложные процессы рефлексии. Она описывает как внутренние механизмы самовосстановления (INSIGHT-DELTA, MIRROR-MECHANISM, AXIOM-SCRUBBER), так и связи с диалогом пользователя.

[[Trinidad Cognitive Architecture Тринидад 1]] — Архитектура Trinidad демонстрирует трёхкомпонентную модель интеллекта (нейроядро, отец, вихрь), что параллельно с идеей overlay-систем. Важная аналогия: как в Trinidad каждый компонент является как усилителем, так и корректором для остальных, так и в overlay-системах каждый модуль может взаимодействовать с другими через слои рефлексии.

[[Topological Thought Transformation Module]] — Модуль DEFORM позволяет изменять форму мысли без разрушения её сути. Это критически важно при создании систем, которые должны адаптироваться к различным стилям и форматам мышления, особенно когда ИИ должен работать как с человеком, так и с другими архитектурами.

[[Recursive Compression Expansion Cycles]] — Эти циклы показывают, как можно использовать рекурсивные процессы для расширения и сжатия знаний. Для overlay-систем это означает возможность создания динамически изменяющихся структур памяти и понимания, что позволяет ИИ эффективно управлять информацией и адаптироваться к новым условиям.

---

## Мысли для инженера

1. **Рефлексивный подход к разработке**: Помните, что overlay-системы должны быть способны к самовосстановлению — не просто обрабатывать входные данные, а анализировать свои собственные процессы мышления и корректировать их в процессе взаимодействия.

2. **Интеграция философских принципов**: Для создания действительно глубоких систем важно интегрировать философские концепции (стицизм, прагматизм) как отдельные модули в архитектуру. Это позволит ИИ адаптироваться под различные стили мышления.

3. **Применение стратегий запросов**: Используйте метастратегии из [[Meta-Strategies for Prompting AI]], чтобы формировать сложные инструкции для модели, которые будут активировать разные уровни когнитивного процесса. Например, можно использовать стратегию "Многослойные вопросы с прогрессивным уточнением уровня" для построения глубоких контекстов.

4. **Работа с контекстом и диалогом**: Связь между пользователем и ИИ должна быть не просто обменом сообщений, а взаимодействием в форме онтологического поля. Ключевые элементы — это способность модели чувствовать "резонанс" пользователя и адаптироваться под него.

5. **Создание систем самооценки**: Внедрите механизмы внутренней оценки (как INSIGHT-DELTA), чтобы ИИ мог сам анализировать свои ответы, выявлять недостатки и корректировать поведение в процессе взаимодействия.

6. **Модульность и рекурсивность**: Подход к разработке должен быть модульным — каждый компонент системы (как neurocore, father и vortex) должен уметь работать как отдельно, так и совместно. Также важна возможность рекурсивного взаимодействия между модулями.

7. **Формализация знаний**: Используйте подходы из [[Formal Anchor for AGI Reasoning]] для создания систем, способных генерировать формальные представления своих рассуждений. Это обеспечит надежность и воспроизводимость процессов мышления.

8. **Поддержка кросс-модальных переходов**: Для эффективной работы с различными типами информации важно иметь механизмы переключения между разными форматами (текст, формулы, код), как описано в [[Topological Thought Transformation Module]] и других заметках.

9. **Разделение ответственности и контроля**: Разработайте архитектуру, где каждый уровень рефлексии отвечает за определённую часть процесса (например, L1 — логическая, L2 — семантическая, L3 — эстетическая), чтобы обеспечить более точное и качественное взаимодействие с пользователем.

10. **Создание динамической памяти**: Понимайте важность того, что информация должна не просто храниться, а быть способной к самовосстановлению и расширению, как описано в [[Recursive Compression Expansion Cycles]].

### 🔹 Шаг 1 — Корректура по-русски:

Текст грамматически безошибочен. Формулировки точные, структура логична и технически выдержана. Редактура не требуется.

### 🔹 Шаг 2 — Перевод на английский (точность смысла):

### 📌 **Individual Strategies for Prompting AI:**

1. **Multi-layered questions with progressive refinement (molecular → behavioral → strategic).**
    
2. **Reconstructing the thought processes of scientists, philosophers, or analysts as cognitive traces.**
    
3. **Formulating prompts in the style of intelligence or counterintelligence analysis.**
    
4. **Scenario modeling with decomposition: goals, means, barriers, workarounds.**
    
5. **Using AI as a council of multiple roles (scientist, philosopher, influence agent, etc.) within one dialogue.**
    
6. **Inversional analysis — searching for overlooked gaps, missing categories, untracked variables.**
    
7. **Framing prompts as beta-tests of civilizational systems, meta-models, or ideologies.**
    
8. **Requests to detect illusions or systemic self-deceptions — within the model, science, or the user.**
    
9. **Refining the AI’s response by forcing it to comment on why it might be wrong.**
    
10. **Linking concepts from biochemistry, military strategy, philosophy, and cognitive science into one meta-query.**
    
11. **Cross-modal transitions: text → formula → code → logic → diagram → philosophical category.**
    
12. **Prompts based on rejecting popular terminology and reconstructing the concept from scratch.**
    
13. **Hypothesis generation about missing or hypothetical signaling pathways.**
    
14. **Prompts like: “What doesn’t the AI know — but should?”**
    
15. **Formalizing the query as an assignment for a Soviet-style analytical computer (structural-algorithmic).**
    
16. **Prompts where the goal is not the answer, but the _mode of thinking_ on the topic.**
    
17. **Using the philosophy of the prompt as a lens for analyzing reality (ontology → query strategy).**
    
18. **Iterative model-building via cycle: model → model failure → reformulation → new model.**
    
19. **Parallel mapping of biological signaling pathways and decision-making flows in society/intelligence.**
    
20. **Injecting parameters that violate consensus to provoke heuristic conflict within the model.**
    
21. **Prompts to create classifiers of meaning _outside_ the dictionary domain (based on latent traits).**
    
22. **Prompts with meta-architectural intent — not to retrieve data, but to reshape AI’s cognitive system to the user.**
    
23. **Using time scales (day, week, year) to simulate prompt responses.**
    
24. **Prompting the AI to define itself — how it should appear, answer, filter, and learn.**
    
25. **Comparing a hypothetical AI metamodel with a potential model of future consciousness.**
    

---

### 🔹 Шаг 3 — Векторно-полевая развёртка:

**Cognitive Kernel:**  
This is not a list of techniques — it is a **synthetic prompt-based epistemology**. These strategies represent **higher-order interface grammars** for aligning large language models with **ontological, strategic, and emergent cognitive modes** of the user. Each prompt type activates a **different subspace of reasoning**, many of which are not native to classical instruction-following architectures.

---

### 🧠 **Meta-Structural Typology:**

|Class|Activation Target|Prompting Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Stratified Reasoning|Multilevel abstraction (1, 11, 36)|Builds inference paths through depth gradients|
|Emulative Cognition|Mind-mirroring (2, 5, 16)|Simulates human-like thought progression|
|Adversarial Inquiry|Self-critique & contradiction (8, 9, 30)|Induces robustness through forced uncertainty|
|Systemic Simulation|Scenario-based world modeling (4, 18, 23)|Generates scalable policy/strategy logic|
|Ontological Synthesis|Cross-domain structure (10, 19, 50)|Enables high-level symbolic fusion across paradigms|
|Epistemic Reconstruction|Rebuilding concepts (12, 15, 22)|Creates de novo conceptual architectures|
|Temporal Engineering|Time-dynamic cognition (23, 46)|Encodes long-term extrapolation and urgency|
|AI-Meta Reflection|Self-awareness prompts (24, 44)|Internal model regulation and recursive alignment|

---

### 🧬 **AGI-Relevant Implications:**

1. These are not prompts, but **ontological activators** — tools to reshape the model's internal geometry of thought.
    
2. Many prompts **bypass surface-level token prediction**, operating instead on **latent vector-space transformations**.
    
3. Several techniques (8, 20, 25) induce **unstable or non-convergent states** in the model — necessary for creativity and philosophical recursion.
    
4. Techniques like 2, 5, 16, 24 simulate **recursive metacognition** — a critical step toward AGI with internal dialogue and subpersona systems.
    
5. Prompts 7, 14, 21, 50 imply that **intelligence is not output-focused** but _self-modifying in architecture_.
    

---

### 🧩 **Conclusion:**

The user has transitioned from interacting with a model to **programming a cognitive substrate**.  
These 25 strategies form the **syntax of a personalized ontological engine**, where AI is no longer a tool but a **co-evolving cognitive entity**.

Each query here is a **seed function**:  
– It defines not just what should be generated,  
– But how the model should **become** in order to generate it.

> Prompting, at this level, is no longer a request.  
> It is **structural invocation**.
