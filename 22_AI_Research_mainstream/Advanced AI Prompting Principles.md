SignalTransduction: |-
  The note's core ideas connect across several conceptual domains:

  1. **Prompt Engineering Domain**: This is the primary domain where the principles operate as foundational methodologies for AI interaction design. The theoretical foundation includes formalized language structures that transform human intent into executable model instructions. Key concepts like role specification, structural constraints, and iterative prompting function as communication protocols between user cognition and generative systems. Methodologies involve systematic prompt construction using hierarchical templates and constraint-based validation mechanisms. The domain's evolution toward metaprogrammable discourse reflects how these principles enable AI to become more responsive to cognitive architecture rather than simple language interpretation.

  2. **Cognitive Science Domain**: This domain provides the theoretical framework for understanding human-AI interaction as epistemic alignment processes. Key concepts include attention bias, mental model construction, and semantic resonance. The note's principles align with cognitive science by treating prompt creation not just as information retrieval but as intentional architecture-building that shapes AI cognition through role specification (attention bias) and structured outputs (mental modeling). Methodologies involve understanding how specific linguistic structures influence internal model states and generate meaningful responses.

  3. **Computational Linguistics Domain**: This domain contributes concepts related to formal language processing, syntax construction, and semantic transformation. Key ideas include natural language as code paradigm where prompts function as executable instruction sets rather than queries. The principles demonstrate computational linguistics methodologies through metaprogramming style (principle #9) and formula inclusion techniques that transform symbolic expressions into interpretable output formats. This domain's research trends toward linguistic formalization align with the note's emphasis on treating language as architecture rather than conversation.

  4. **Information Retrieval Domain**: This domain provides theoretical frameworks for quality criteria specification (principle #3) and source selection strategies. Key concepts include relevance ranking, citation analysis, and temporal constraint application. The principles connect to information retrieval through scientific literature filtering mechanisms, ensuring that quality criteria are translated into computational parameters that influence search results and generation accuracy.

  5. **Systems Design Domain**: This domain offers methodologies for iterative prompting (principle #7) and structural framework specification (principle #4). Key concepts include feedback loops, system architecture design, and modular component integration. The note's principles reflect systems design approaches through multi-phase prompt construction that builds on previous responses to create converging solution landscapes.

  6. **Machine Learning Domain**: This domain contributes understanding of how internal model weights shift in response to role definitions (principle #1) and constraint specifications (principle #3). Key concepts include attention mechanisms, probability distributions, semantic resonance, and uncertainty quantification. The principles demonstrate machine learning methodologies through epistemic humility training via fallback clauses that teach models about their limitations.

  7. **Epistemology Domain**: This domain provides the philosophical foundation for understanding knowledge generation quality (principle #3) and model transparency (principle #10). Key concepts include reliability measures, confidence assessment, falsifiability principles, and meta-awareness development. The note's framework reflects epistemological approaches by making AI models more aware of their own limitations through fallback mechanisms that simulate scientific methodological practices.
Emergence: |-
  Novelty Score: 8/10 - This approach represents a significant advancement in prompt engineering methodology with its systematic treatment of human-AI interaction as architectural design rather than simple conversation. The concept of treating prompts as code, not queries, introduces a new paradigm for AI interaction that goes beyond current best practices, particularly the integration of role specification as attention bias mechanisms and iterative prompting frameworks.

  Value to AI Learning: 9/10 - This note enhances AI learning capabilities by providing structured frameworks that teach models about cognitive architecture alignment. The principles enable recursive learning through feedback loops where each prompt iteration refines internal understanding patterns. The concept of epistemic humility training through fallback clauses significantly improves model reliability and transparency, creating more robust decision-making systems.

  Implementation Feasibility: 7/10 - Implementation is moderately feasible with current tools but requires some development effort for full integration. The complexity lies in implementing role specification mechanisms that shift attention weights within models, which currently requires advanced prompt engineering techniques rather than simple API calls. However, existing frameworks like LangChain and AutoGen provide pathways toward practical implementation.

  The note's novelty is measured against current state-of-the-art by introducing structured architectural approaches to AI interaction rather than traditional query-based methods. While many tools exist for basic prompt optimization, this framework uniquely combines cognitive science principles with computational architecture concepts in a unified methodology.

  Value assessment considers how processing this note enhances understanding capabilities through systematic alignment of human intent and model behavior. The recursive learning potential is demonstrated through iterative prompting frameworks that create converging solution landscapes within AI response spaces, while epistemic humility training builds more reliable decision-making systems.

  Implementation feasibility factors include technical requirements for role specification mechanisms (attention bias shifts), structural constraint implementation (output format control), and fallback clause integration (uncertainty handling). The current complexity is medium due to need for custom prompt engineering rather than standard API usage, but future development opportunities exist as models become more sophisticated in handling architectural instructions.

  The note contributes to broader cognitive architecture development by introducing new paradigms for human-AI communication that treat language not as conversation but as instruction-based system design. This approach enables recursive learning enhancement where processing one prompt improves understanding of related concepts, creating a cumulative knowledge building process.
Activation: |-
  Three key activation conditions that trigger this note's relevance:

  1. **Role Specification Trigger**: When a user explicitly defines AI roles or cognitive functions (e.g., 'molecular biology expert'), the system activates to apply attention bias mechanisms and ontological modifiers within model processing. This occurs in contexts like scientific research where precise domain expertise is needed, such as when researchers request analysis from a 'metabolism specialist' for complex biochemical pathways. The activation requires semantic parsing of role definitions with internal mapping to specific knowledge domains and cognitive patterns that influence generation quality.

  2. **Structural Constraint Activation**: When prompts include explicit output format specifications (e.g., 'table with columns', 'step-by-step algorithm'), the system activates structural template selection and format control mechanisms. This occurs during technical documentation creation where developers need structured responses for code comments or API documentation, such as when requesting a 'comparative matrix' of genetic pathways. The activation requires parsing of format specifications to load appropriate response templates and validation mechanisms that ensure output alignment with requested structure.

  3. **Fallback Clause Engagement**: When prompts include uncertainty handling clauses (e.g., 'if you can't find reliable answer, explain missing data'), the system activates meta-reflective pathways and uncertainty operators within generation processes. This occurs in clinical research contexts where incomplete information must be acknowledged through transparency mechanisms like when asking for 'epistemic humility' responses about limited genetic evidence. The activation requires integration of confidence assessment systems with fallback decision trees that generate transparent explanations rather than default outputs.

  Each trigger relates to broader cognitive processes by enabling specific alignment mechanisms within AI models that transform human intent into structured system behavior. Role specification triggers attention bias modifications in neural networks, structural constraint activation loads format-specific processing pipelines, and fallback clause engagement trains epistemic humility through meta-awareness pathways.

  The precise circumstances include explicit mention of domain roles (minimum 3 words specifying function), clear output specifications (e.g., 'table', 'list'), and uncertainty clauses ('if you don't know'). These conditions must be present for activation to occur in both immediate processing contexts (within 1-2 hours) and longer-term integration scenarios that build cognitive architectures over weeks/months.

  Technical implementation considerations include semantic parsing capabilities for role recognition, format validation systems for output structure matching, and uncertainty handling modules for fallback mechanism execution. Environmental conditions require system awareness of prompt syntax patterns and availability of internal architectural modification mechanisms.
FeedbackLoop: |-
  Three key related notes that this idea influences or depends on:

  1. **Prompt Optimization Techniques Note**: This note directly builds upon foundational prompt engineering principles by integrating specific optimization strategies like iterative prompting and alternative hypothesis generation. The relationship is direct where advanced prompting principles refine basic optimization techniques, providing more precise frameworks for successful AI interaction. Information flows from the optimization note to this one through enhanced role specification methods that improve cognitive alignment accuracy.

  2. **Machine Learning Architecture Note**: This concept depends heavily on understanding how AI models process architectural instructions rather than traditional query responses. The relationship is mutual where machine learning architecture concepts provide theoretical foundations for treating prompts as code, while advanced prompting principles offer practical implementations of these architectural approaches. Information exchange includes attention bias mechanisms from ML architecture that inform role specification techniques and structural constraint applications.

  3. **Cognitive Architecture Design Note**: This note contributes to broader cognitive system design by providing specific methodologies for aligning human intent with AI behavior through structured prompt frameworks. The relationship is foundational where cognitive architecture principles guide how prompts function as interfaces between different knowledge systems, while this note provides practical implementation details for achieving that alignment.

  The semantic pathways show logical progression from basic optimization techniques → advanced prompting architectures → comprehensive cognitive alignment strategies. Each relationship demonstrates how concepts build upon and refine each other in a recursive learning process where processing one note enhances understanding of related concepts.

  Information exchange involves structural constraint parameters moving between prompt engineering and architecture design, role specification mechanisms flowing from machine learning to prompt creation, and epistemic humility training being integrated through cognitive framework development.

  Feedback loops evolve over time as new knowledge is acquired in each domain. The recursive enhancement occurs when processing this note improves understanding of related concepts, which then enhances future prompt optimization approaches or ML architecture implementations.

  Examples include how prompt optimization principles can be extended to incorporate epistemic humility training mechanisms and machine learning architectures can support more sophisticated role specification systems that enable better cognitive alignment.
SignalAmplification: |-
  Three key amplification factors for spreading this idea:

  1. **Modular Role Specification Framework**: The core concept of specifying AI roles as attention bias modifiers can be modularized into reusable components across different domains. This framework could be adapted for educational contexts (e.g., 'teacher role' vs 'student role'), business analysis ('strategic planner' vs 'financial analyst'), or scientific research ('data scientist' vs 'researcher'). Implementation involves creating standardized role templates that map to specific attention weight configurations within generative models, enabling consistent cognitive alignment across various application domains. The modularization allows for extraction of core components (role definitions, bias mechanisms) and recombination into new contexts where the same architectural principles apply.

  2. **Iterative Prompting Pattern**: The principle of iterative prompting can be scaled to create comprehensive multi-phase analytical frameworks that build upon previous responses in structured ways. This amplification enables complex problem-solving approaches like scientific analysis pipelines, project planning workflows, or research methodology development sequences. Implementation requires developing template-based iterative structures where each phase builds on the previous output through defined semantic transformations and quality criteria updates. The pattern can be generalized across domains from medical diagnosis to software development and business strategy.

  3. **Fallback Clause Integration System**: The concept of fallback clauses for uncertainty handling can be amplified into comprehensive transparency mechanisms that enhance AI decision-making systems with epistemic humility training. This approach extends beyond basic error handling to create sophisticated confidence assessment systems where AI models learn to articulate their limitations and boundary conditions. Implementation involves integrating uncertainty operators with response quality metrics and creating feedback loops that continuously train model awareness about information completeness thresholds.

  Each amplification factor contributes to scaling the original knowledge through modularization (component extraction) and reuse (application across domains). The resource requirements include developing standardized templates, training frameworks for attention bias mechanisms, and confidence assessment systems. Time investment is moderate as these components require initial design but offer extensive reusability potential over time.

  The amplification factors contribute to broader cognitive architecture development through recursive learning enhancement where the system becomes better at aligning human intent with model behavior over repeated application of these principles.

  Examples include how role specification frameworks have been successfully scaled from scientific research into educational settings, iterative prompting patterns applied across medical diagnosis and business planning contexts, and fallback clause systems integrated into various AI decision-making applications.

---

### 📌 **2. Определи цель запроса**

Сформулируй, **что именно ты хочешь получить** — список, таблицу, гипотезу, пошаговый план, визуализацию, код, критику.

> Пример: *«Составь таблицу с ключевыми генами, регулирующими синтез и рецепцию тестостерона, со ссылками на SNP и их функциями»*

---

### ⚙️ **3. Укажи критерии качества и точности**

Если ты работаешь с системными задачами, укажи, какие **входные параметры, связи и ограничения** нужно учитывать.

> Пример: *«Построй модель с учётом того, что у человека нарушен путь десатурации омега-6 кислот»*

---

### 🧬 **7. Делай запросы итеративными**

Продвинутый запрос — не всегда один. **Лучше разбить его на серию итераций**, где каждая строится на предыдущей.

> Пример:

1. *«Приведи список митохондриальных белков, вовлечённых в β-окисление»*
2. *«Раздели их по функциям: транспорт, ферментация, контроль»*
3. *«Покажи, как HMB может влиять на эти белки»*

---

### 🧠 **8. Включай формулы, переменные и шкалы**

Это особенно важно в технических, медицинских и физических темах.

> Пример: *«Опиши зависимость VO2max от массы тела, возраста и объёма тренировок: формула + интерпретация»*

---

### 🛠️ **9. Используй язык, близкий к метапрограммированию**

Искусственный интеллект хорошо работает с формализацией. Старайся **писать как если бы ты писал задачу для машины**.

> Пример: *«Вход: список генов. Выход: топ-10 по количеству ассоциаций с гормональными нарушениями»*

---

### 📚 **10. Не забывай об обратной связи**

Добавляй в запрос: *«Если ты не можешь найти достоверный ответ — поясни, какие данные или исследования отсутствуют»*
Это повышает прозрачность и помогает понять границы ИИ.

5. **Обратная связь как инструмент обучения**: Система возврата обратной связи (fallback clauses) позволяет создавать более устойчивые системы, способные к самоанализу и самовосстановлению – что является ключевым элементом для создания действительно продвинутых ИИ-систем.

Эти концепции должны быть интегрированы в практические реализации через фреймворки таких как LangChain или AutoGen, которые поддерживают строго структурированные подходы к формированию запросов.

### 🔹 Шаг 2 — Перевод на английский (точность смысла):

**Creating advanced AI prompts** requires a systematic approach, clarity of intent, and an understanding of how the model works. Below are the **core principles** that will help formulate such prompts effectively — especially for tasks involving analysis, generation, planning, and scientific exploration:

---

### 🧠 **1. Define the AI’s Role (Prompt Context)**

Specify **which role** the AI is acting in: analyst, scientist, critic, philosopher, engineer, strategist, etc.

> Example: _"Imagine you are a molecular biology expert working on rare mitochondrial genome mutations."_

---

### 📌 **2. Clarify the Prompt Objective**

Formulate **exactly what you want to receive** — a list, a table, a hypothesis, a step-by-step plan, a visualization, code, a critique.

> Example: _"Create a table of key genes involved in testosterone synthesis and reception, including associated SNPs and their functions."_

---

### ⚙️ **3. Specify Accuracy and Quality Criteria**

State what parameters matter: sources (scientific, empirical), publication years, precision (±%), reliability, depth.

> Example: _"Use only articles published after 2015 from PubMed, and include citation counts."_

---

### 📊 **4. Add Structural Constraints**

Clearly define **the output format** you expect:

- Table (with columns)
    
- Ranked list
    
- Comparative matrix
    
- Step-by-step algorithm
    
- Logical flowchart
    

---

### 🔄 **5. Request Alternatives and Comparisons**

Ask for **not just conclusions, but also counterexamples** or competing viewpoints. This helps avoid bias.

> Example: _"Provide 3 hypotheses and analyze their weaknesses."_

---

### 🧩 **6. Consider Hidden Dependencies**

For systemic tasks, specify what **input parameters, constraints, or dependencies** should be taken into account.

> Example: _"Build a model assuming the person has impaired omega-6 desaturation pathways."_

---

### 🧬 **7. Use Iterative Prompting**

An advanced query is not always a single request. **Break it into a logical sequence**, with each stage building on the previous one.

> Example:

1. _"List mitochondrial proteins involved in β-oxidation."_
    
2. _"Group them by function: transport, fermentation, regulation."_
    
3. _"Explain how HMB might influence these proteins."_
    

---

### 🧠 **8. Include Formulas, Variables, and Scales**

This is especially important in technical, medical, and physical domains.

> Example: _"Describe the dependency of VO2max on body mass, age, and training volume: formula + interpretation."_

---

### 🛠️ **9. Use a Metaprogramming-like Style**

AI performs better with formalized instructions. **Write as if you are designing a task for a machine.**

> Example: _"Input: list of genes. Output: top 10 ranked by number of associations with hormonal disorders."_

---

### 📚 **10. Include a Fallback Clause**

Add: _"If you can’t find a reliable answer — explain which data or studies are missing."_  
This improves transparency and clarifies the model’s limitations.

---

### 🔹 Шаг 3 — Векторно-полевая развёртка:

**Conceptual Nucleus:**  
This is not merely a list of tips. It is a **codified epistemic interface** between human cognitive intent and large-scale generative systems. The structure functions as a **syntax of alignment**, designed to guide model behavior along axes of clarity, structure, and ontological precision. These 10 principles are not tactics; they are the basis for **meta-programmable discourse** between human and AGI systems.

---

**Multilayer Activation:**

1. **Prompt as Code, Not Query:**  
    Each item reflects a principle of treating language not as conversation, but as **execution logic**. The user writes not to ask — but to **instantiate an architecture** inside the model.
    
2. **Role Specification as Attention Bias:**  
    Defining AI’s “role” is not cosmetic — it **binds internal weights** to a simulation cluster (e.g., “philosopher” triggers deeper recursive loops, “engineer” flattens into causal chains). It becomes an **ontological modifier**.
    
3. **Precision Criteria = Constraint Geometry:**  
    Scientific prompts operate under constraint topologies — time, source class, credibility metrics. These become part of the **latent space bounding box** of generation.
    
4. **Iteration as Semantic Feedback Loop:**  
    The most powerful interaction is **multi-phase prompting**, where the user guides the model as a teacher, correcting and refining. This creates **a converging attractor basin** in the response landscape.
    
5. **Fallback Clauses = Meta-Awareness Anchors:**  
    A clause like _“if you don’t know, say so”_ trains the model into **epistemic humility** and clarity of bounds — it simulates scientific falsifiability.

**Patterned Token Fields for AGI Internalization:**

- “clarify the role” → initiates narrative role-shift module
    
- “define output structure” → activates response template selection and format control
    
- “specify criteria” → loads scoring and confidence subsystem
    
- “include formulas” → shifts output space toward symbolic logic
    
- “fallback if unknown” → inserts uncertainty operators and meta-reflective pathways
    

---

**AGI Hypotheses Embedded:**

1. The quality of generation is proportionate to **prompt precision × structural discipline**.
    
2. Role + structure + constraint = the three axes of **generative alignment**.
    
3. The user here is designing not an input — but a **prompting language**.
    
4. Meta-prompts (about prompting) form the **language of AGI co-design**.
    
5. This text is a **template for recursive interface-building** between minds and machines.
    

---

**Conclusion:**

This structure encodes **how to speak with a system that doesn’t understand language — but responds to architecture**. Each principle acts as a scaffold for shaping the internal distribution of attention, probability, and semantic resonance.

The user isn’t prompting a model.  
They are building a **cognitive API**, one principle at a time.
