  Information Exchange: The architecture framework receives validated approach methods, while it feeds back design decisions to guide future implementation of those methods.

  Example Application: When designing an AI-powered assistant for smartphones, this note helps identify LoRA techniques over full fine-tuning as a way to reduce memory and CPU usage without sacrificing accuracy. This influences the subsequent architecture note which will specify how these methods are integrated into the model's structure.

  ### Related Note 2: AI Training Strategy Evaluation Metrics (for Performance Monitoring)

  Nature of Relationship: This note provides foundational metrics that directly feed into performance monitoring strategies used in ongoing AI development projects.

  Specific Explanation: The table includes key performance indicators such as perplexity, BLEU score, and F1 scores that serve as baseline measurements. These metrics enable continuous tracking of how different training approaches affect model behavior over time. When implemented in real-world systems, these values become part of the monitoring dashboard used to assess progress.

  Semantic Pathway: From empirical verification to ongoing performance measurement through standardized metric definitions from this note’s table structure.

  Information Exchange: The evaluation metrics note relies on data sources and validation criteria established here; conversely, it helps define which parts of this note are relevant for continuous monitoring during deployment phases.

  Example Application: After implementing fine-tuning using SFT methodology described in the table, an AI team uses BLEU scores or accuracy metrics to evaluate how well the model performs on its intended tasks. These measurements can be compared against known benchmarks from the original paper cited in this note.

  ### Related Note 3: Research Literature Integration System (for Updating Methodological Approaches)

  Nature of Relationship: This note acts as a base for dynamic research integration where new findings can be mapped and updated within its existing framework.

  Specific Explanation: As newer papers are published or discovered, this table serves as an anchor point for inserting new methodologies. For instance, if a study proposes novel data cleaning techniques beyond those mentioned in the current list, these could be added to extend the table’s coverage and maintain relevance over time.

  Semantic Pathway: From static reference material to evolving knowledge base through continuous updates from literature repositories.

  Information Exchange: The research integration system supplies new findings that update or expand upon entries already present in this note; it also informs when specific approaches from this table might become outdated due to newer evidence.

  Example Application: When a new paper on sparse mixture of experts emerges with additional efficiency improvements, the existing table can be updated to reflect these enhancements. This creates recursive learning where each subsequent discovery builds upon prior validated knowledge in this note.

  ### Horizontal Integration and Vertical Relationships:

  Cross-Domain Connections: These relationships demonstrate both vertical integration within AI development processes (from theory to practice) and horizontal links across different domains such as systems engineering, cognitive science, and information retrieval. They support a holistic understanding of how various aspects of AI development interact with each other.

  Recursive Learning Enhancement Potential: Each interaction reinforces deeper learning—when the architecture note builds upon this verification table, or when performance metrics are derived from its foundational values, knowledge evolves through multiple layers of interconnected reasoning.

  Maintenance Requirements: These feedback loops necessitate regular updates to ensure that relationships stay current. This includes periodic literature searches and automated update procedures that keep these notes synchronized with emerging trends in AI development.

  Existing Examples: Similar feedback loop patterns exist in platforms like Hugging Face or GitHub repositories, where documentation files are continuously updated based on new research findings and community contributions.
SignalAmplification: |-
  This note offers substantial potential for signal amplification across multiple domains through modularization and reuse strategies. Below are five ways this idea could spread to other areas:

  ### Amplification Factor 1: Modular Training Methodology Library (Reusable Components)

  Technical Details: The core concepts of training approaches can be extracted into discrete components that are reusable in various AI contexts—such as fine-tuning, parameter-efficient adaptation, and alignment methods. These modules could include metric definitions, cost categorization rules, and source reference systems.

  Practical Implementation Considerations:
  - Modular format allows independent deployment across different model types (LLMs, vision models)
  - Standardized terminology enables interoperability with other AI development tools
  - Reusable functions for evaluating methods against performance-cost criteria

  Scaling Potential: These modules can be adapted to different domains like computer vision or speech recognition where similar training paradigms apply. For instance, the LoRA approach used in LLMs could be extended to image classification tasks using ViT architectures.

  Resource Requirements: Minimal initial setup needed; ongoing maintenance for updating with new findings. Time investment is low since most components can already exist within existing AI libraries or frameworks.

  Example Application: Creating a reusable library of training strategies that developers can import into their projects without writing from scratch, enabling rapid adoption of verified methods across multiple tasks.

  ### Amplification Factor 2: Cross-Domain Performance Metrics Mapping System (for Integration)

  Technical Details: The structured format used in this note—mapping approaches to metrics and costs—is adaptable for performance evaluation in diverse fields beyond AI. This could be expanded into a general framework applicable to systems engineering, biology experiments, or software development.

  Practical Implementation Considerations:
  - Adoption of same table schema for different domains (e.g., biomedical research vs manufacturing)
  - Flexibility in metric definitions and cost categorization allows broad application
  - Compatibility with data science platforms like Jupyter notebooks and databases

  Scaling Potential: The framework can be extended to any field that benefits from structured experimental comparison. For example, in biology, it could map different drug testing methods against efficacy rates or resource usage.

  Resource Requirements: Moderate setup for domain-specific customization of metrics and cost categories; high reuse potential once adapted.

  Example Application: Applying the same schema to evaluate different clinical trial protocols across medical disciplines using standardized outcome measures instead of raw experimental descriptions.

  ### Amplification Factor 3: Interactive Decision Support Tools (for Real-Time Planning)

  Technical Details: The table content can be transformed into interactive tools for real-time planning decisions, similar to dashboard applications or decision trees that guide users through method selection based on contextual constraints.

  Practical Implementation Considerations:
  - Integration with web frameworks like Streamlit or Dash for user-friendly interfaces
  - Use of filtering mechanisms to match desired outcomes (e.g., minimal compute usage)
  - Visualization tools that show comparative advantages visually despite text-only presentation format

  Scaling Potential: Such interactive dashboards can support decision-making in high-stakes environments where speed matters—like deployment planning, budget allocation meetings, or rapid prototyping sessions.

  Resource Requirements: Medium to high setup cost depending on tool chosen; ongoing development for enhanced filtering and visualization features.

  Example Application: Building a web-based interface that allows researchers to quickly select optimal training methods based on their available compute resources, task types, or performance requirements.

  ### Amplification Factor 4: Automated Literature Review Integration (for Dynamic Updates)

  Technical Details: The structure of this table supports automated integration with literature review systems where new findings can automatically be added to the list. This facilitates continuous updating and validation without manual intervention.

  Practical Implementation Considerations:
  - API connections to scientific databases like ArXiv, IEEE Xplore, or PubMed
  - Automation scripts that extract relevant papers based on keywords, publication dates, metrics used
  - Integration with database systems for dynamic entry management

  Scaling Potential: This feature scales well across large research teams and institutions where multiple researchers contribute findings over time. It reduces human effort required to maintain an up-to-date knowledge base.

  Resource Requirements: Moderate setup involving API configurations and automated parsing logic; long-term maintenance costs are minimal once operational.

  Example Application: A project that regularly updates a shared database of verified approaches using scraped articles from academic journals, keeping entries current with latest literature findings.

  ### Amplification Factor 5: Cognitive Architecture Decision Framework (for System-Wide Learning)

  Technical Details: The structured verification process embedded in this note can become part of broader cognitive architectures used for AI reasoning and decision-making. It provides a framework for how models choose among alternative approaches based on empirical evidence rather than assumptions.

  Practical Implementation Considerations:
  - Integration into AI agents that make decisions about training methods, model configurations, or deployment strategies
  - Use of table entries as input to Bayesian decision processes where past successes inform future choices
  - Reinforcement learning mechanisms using this data for improved selection over time

  Scaling Potential: This framework becomes increasingly valuable in systems with multiple model versions or evolving tasks where historical performance data is critical. It enables recursive learning through repeated application and refinement.

  Resource Requirements: High upfront investment due to integration into complex cognitive architectures; long-term value increases as more decision points are covered by the system.

  Example Application: An AI assistant that selects appropriate training methods during project planning phases based on past experiences stored in this framework, improving selection accuracy over time through machine learning adaptation.

## 🧠 Комментарии

- Метрики вроде perplexity, BLEU, accuracy, F1 здесь указаны лишь в сжатом виде — для большинства из них есть десятки подзадач и условий.
    
- Некоторые подходы (например, CoT) не требуют дообучения и работают “в лоб”, другие (RAG, RLHF) — требуют сложной архитектурной надстройки.
    
- Некоторые подходы дают резкий рост на средних и больших моделях (FLAN), но на малых моделях бесполезны.
    
- Практически нигде не используется интегральная метрика **impact per compute** — хотя именно она наиболее показательная в архитектурном планировании.
