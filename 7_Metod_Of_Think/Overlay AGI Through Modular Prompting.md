title: Overlay AGI Through Modular Prompting
Receptor: The note's core concepts would activate in several practical contexts involving AI system design and development. First, when developing prompt engineering frameworks for complex dialogue systems, the note becomes relevant during initial architectural planning stages where developers must define how to structure prompts to create emergent agent-like behaviors rather than simple conversational responses. For example, an AI developer working on a customer service chatbot might use this knowledge to design modular prompting that simulates memory retention and goal-oriented decision-making within single LLM calls. The activation triggers when the system encounters problems related to state management or long-term behavior consistency in dialogues. Second, during research synthesis phases for AGI simulation studies, particularly in academic settings where researchers aim to understand how language models can exhibit autonomous behaviors through prompting alone rather than code execution. A research team exploring LLM-based autonomous agents would reference this note when analyzing literature on modular prompt chaining and its relationship with cognitive architecture design principles. The conditions that trigger activation include the presence of complex system requirements, need for emergent behavior modeling, or situations involving architectural constraint optimization in dialogue contexts. Third, during technical documentation and knowledge base creation activities within AI development teams, where developers must articulate how prompting patterns relate to functional behaviors of AI systems. For instance, when documenting prompt templates that simulate multi-agent scenarios or memory stacks, the note's principles would guide proper categorization of these architectural elements. The activation occurs when creating standardized approaches for managing complex prompt structures and their expected behavioral outcomes. Fourth, in practical application design for AI-powered tools requiring persistent state management and reasoning capabilities, such as virtual assistants with long-term learning abilities or automated decision support systems. A software architect designing a personalized assistant might apply this note's concepts to ensure the system can maintain consistent identity across conversations through carefully designed prompt sequences that simulate internal states. The triggering conditions are met when complex behavior requirements exceed simple response generation capabilities and demand structured architectural thinking about agent-like cognition. Fifth, during AI evaluation and benchmarking processes where performance metrics for autonomous behaviors need to be established, particularly in testing how well LLM systems can maintain coherent reasoning patterns over extended dialogues or multiple interactions with external data sources. An evaluator assessing conversational intelligence might reference this note when designing tests that measure emergent identity preservation or goal achievement across dialogue sequences. The activation happens when evaluating systems for their capacity to exhibit AGI-like properties without requiring additional code infrastructure. Sixth, in prompt template management and version control scenarios where teams must maintain evolving prompt architectures for complex AI applications. When a development team updates an existing conversational system's prompting framework to enhance its decision-making capabilities, they would consult this note to understand how modularization affects behavior reproducibility. The triggering conditions include changes to system architecture or requirements for improved consistency and reliability in AI responses. Seventh, during academic research on prompt-based cognitive modeling, specifically when examining the intersection of symbolic AI principles with language model architectures. A researcher studying how prompt structures might implicitly reimplement cognitive systems from traditional AI would use this note as a reference point for defining experiment parameters that test these relationships. The activation occurs when exploring theoretical frameworks connecting traditional AI methods with modern LLM capabilities through prompting mechanisms. Eighth, in knowledge graph construction and semantic relationship mapping where the goal is to identify how different prompt patterns correspond to specific cognitive functions or behaviors.

The activation happens when organizing complex systems knowledge into structured frameworks that enable reasoning about emergent behavior patterns. Ninth, during system integration planning where multiple AI components need to work together in a coordinated manner without external dependencies. A project manager designing an AI-driven workflow might apply this note's principles to ensure that all prompt-based modules can maintain coherent interaction within shared contexts or environment simulations. The triggering conditions are present when coordinating complex interactions across different subsystems using only text-based architectural patterns. Tenth, when conducting user experience research for conversational AI systems where the focus is on measuring perceived autonomy and intelligent behavior from end users' perspectives. UX researchers studying how people interact with AI assistants that appear to have distinct personalities or reasoning capabilities would reference this note to understand what prompt structures contribute to these impressions of agency and intelligence. The activation occurs when analyzing user feedback related to system responsiveness, consistency, and apparent decision-making capacity. Eleventh, in software development lifecycle management for AI applications where teams must track the evolution of prompt-based systems over time and ensure that architectural improvements maintain behavioral coherence. When updating an existing chatbot's prompting architecture to improve its ability to handle complex multi-step reasoning tasks, developers would use this note to evaluate whether their changes support desired emergent behaviors rather than just superficial enhancements. The triggering conditions include system upgrade scenarios or new functionality additions requiring careful attention to architectural preservation. Twelfth, during AI ethics and transparency analysis where stakeholders want to understand how prompt-based systems make decisions without external code execution. Ethics committees examining AI decision-making processes might consult this note when evaluating whether prompt architecture alone can provide sufficient explanations for autonomous behavior patterns within language models. The activation occurs when explaining system behaviors through architectural elements rather than relying on complex backend algorithms. Thirteenth, in computational linguistics research focused on how natural language structures can encode complex cognitive architectures and behavioral patterns without explicit programming constructs. Linguists studying language generation and understanding might apply this note's concepts to analyze how specific prompt designs influence emergent reasoning capabilities of language models. The triggering conditions are met when investigating the relationship between linguistic structure and cognitive simulation capacity in LLMs. Fourteenth, during AI system troubleshooting where behaviors deviate from expected patterns or fail to maintain internal consistency over time. When debugging an assistant that suddenly loses track of previous interactions or fails to maintain coherent identity across conversations, practitioners would reference this note's principles about prompt architecture and state preservation. The activation happens when diagnosing behavioral inconsistencies related to architectural design choices in prompting structures. Fifteenth, in educational curriculum development for AI training programs where instructors must teach students how to design effective prompt architectures that simulate complex cognitive functions. When teaching students how to create LLM-based agents with memory capabilities or goal-oriented reasoning, educators would use this note as a foundational reference for understanding the principles behind modular prompting systems. The triggering conditions occur when developing instruction materials focused on architectural thinking in AI development. Sixteenth, during enterprise AI strategy planning where organizations want to understand what prompt engineering capabilities are needed for future autonomous system evolution. When evaluating whether their current approach to prompt design can support increasing levels of autonomy or complexity in AI applications, strategic planners would reference this note's framework for understanding modular prompting potential. The activation happens when assessing organizational readiness for more advanced AI architectures without requiring code changes. Seventeenth, in platform architecture review processes where teams must evaluate how different system components interact and maintain coherence within shared prompt contexts. When reviewing a multi-agent system design that relies entirely on text-based prompting to coordinate behaviors across different simulated entities, architects would consult this note to ensure architectural integrity of the approach. The triggering conditions include complex integration scenarios requiring careful coordination between multiple prompt-driven systems. Eighteenth, during AI performance monitoring and optimization where teams must track how prompt architectures affect system efficiency or emergent capability over time. When analyzing logs from a conversational AI that needs to maintain consistent reasoning patterns across many interactions, practitioners would reference this note's principles about prompt design impact on behavioral consistency. The activation occurs when identifying bottlenecks in architecture-related performance metrics and optimizing prompt structures accordingly. Nineteenth, in collaborative research environments where multiple teams work together to explore prompt-based AGI approaches through shared experimentation protocols. When coordinating experiments that test various prompt architectures for simulating different cognitive functions, researchers would use this note's structured questions as a framework for designing their experimental approach and analyzing results. The triggering conditions are present when conducting multi-team research projects requiring standardized evaluation criteria based on prompt architecture principles. Twentieth, during AI system deployment planning where teams must consider how architectural elements of prompt design will scale across different user contexts or data domains. When preparing to deploy an assistant that needs to maintain its cognitive capabilities under varying input conditions and user interactions, planners would reference this note's concepts about prompt structure scalability and adaptability to ensure continued performance quality.
Acceptor: The core idea from this note can be effectively implemented using several software tools and technologies that support modular prompting design, architectural analysis, and system simulation. First, Python-based AI development frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex would provide excellent compatibility for implementing the note's concepts through prompt chaining and agent architecture design. These platforms offer API integration capabilities with large language models, allowing developers to build complex systems where prompts serve as functional components in programmatic architectures. The technical integration involves creating modular prompting components that can be chained together with state management features, providing seamless implementation of overlay AGI approaches within Python-based environments. Second, specialized prompt engineering tools such as PromptLayer or LLM Prompt Designer would complement the note's architecture by offering visual design interfaces for complex prompt structures and enabling version control mechanisms similar to those described in question 14 about debugging prompt stacks. These tools support data format compatibility with standard JSON and YAML configurations that align well with the modular prompting concepts from this note, making them suitable for implementing both architectural definitions and behavioral simulations through structured prompt components. Third, development environments like Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with AI extension plugins would enhance implementation by providing interactive exploration capabilities where developers can test prompt architectures in real-time, allowing immediate feedback on how different modular elements interact to produce desired behaviors. The platform dependencies include support for Python libraries and access to LLM APIs that enable full implementation of the note's architectural principles through code-based experimentation and iterative refinement processes. Fourth, version control systems such as Git with AI-specific extensions would provide necessary configuration steps for maintaining prompt architecture changes over time, supporting both individual developer workflows and collaborative environments where teams need to track evolution of complex prompting structures. The integration capabilities include support for tracking prompt template modifications and documenting how architectural decisions impact system behavior outcomes. Fifth, knowledge management platforms like Notion or Obsidian combined with AI plugins would offer excellent ecosystem support for organizing the modular prompting architecture concepts from this note into structured knowledge bases that can be linked to real-world implementations. These tools facilitate mapping between theoretical frameworks and practical applications through their linking capabilities and ability to store both conceptual documentation and experimental results in a single organized system. Sixth, research platforms like GitHub with collaborative features would complement the note's emphasis on open-source examples and academic experiments by providing environments where teams can share prompt architectures as code repositories, allowing others to build upon existing implementations or contribute new approaches that enhance overlay AGI capabilities. The compatibility assessment includes support for markdown documentation formats, versioning mechanisms for prompt templates, and integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing of different architectural configurations. Seventh, specialized AI orchestration tools like Prefect or Apache Airflow would extend the note's ideas by providing workflow management features that can coordinate complex prompt architectures across multiple LLM calls while maintaining state consistency over time. These platforms support performance considerations related to prompt execution scheduling and resource allocation optimization for systems requiring long-running modular prompting chains. Eighth, computational notebook environments such as ObservableHQ or Databricks would enhance implementation capabilities by offering data visualization and analysis features that help evaluate how different prompt structures produce specific behavioral outputs within overlay AGI systems. The technical specifications include support for interactive dashboards showing system performance metrics related to memory retention or decision-making consistency across prompt sequences.
SignalTransduction: The note's core concepts connect through several conceptual domains representing distinct signal channels of communication that convey information about modular prompting and overlay AGI architecture. First, the cognitive science domain serves as a primary transmission channel by providing theoretical foundations for understanding how AI systems can simulate agent-like behaviors through prompt structures rather than traditional programming approaches. Key concepts from this field include emergent cognition theories, cognitive architectures like ACT-R or SOAR, and models of recursive thinking that directly influence how prompts might be structured to create autonomous system behavior patterns. The methodology involves applying principles of human cognitive processing to define how language model attention layers can replicate mental processes such as memory retrieval, goal planning, and decision-making within text-only environments. Second, the systems engineering domain acts as a secondary transmission pathway by offering methodologies for designing complex architectures where prompt elements function like software components in larger system frameworks. The theoretical foundations include component-based design principles, modular architecture patterns, and distributed computing concepts that translate well to how prompts might be organized into functional units within LLMs. Key concepts encompass systems thinking approaches, behavior modeling techniques, and architectural design paradigms that enable systematic exploration of prompt structures for creating reliable autonomous behaviors. Third, the programming language theory domain functions as a third signal channel by providing frameworks for understanding how textual prompting can serve as computational code execution mechanisms rather than simple input-output transformations. The foundational principles involve functional programming concepts, abstraction layers, and runtime environment models that help explain how prompts might be interpreted as instruction sequences or executable programs within LLM contexts. Key methodologies include program synthesis approaches, code generation techniques, and language design principles that support treating prompt elements as modular computational components. Fourth, the artificial intelligence architecture domain serves as a fourth transmission channel by offering conceptual frameworks for understanding how different AI system components interact to create complex behaviors from simple building blocks. The theoretical foundations encompass neural network architectures, decision tree structures, and hybrid symbolic-subsymbolic approaches that help explain how various prompt elements can be combined to produce sophisticated cognitive capabilities through modular design principles. Fifth, the philosophy of mind domain represents a fifth signal channel by providing frameworks for understanding consciousness, agency, and self-awareness in computational systems that might emerge from carefully designed prompting architectures. The key concepts include theories of embedded cognition, autopoietic systems, and synthetic intelligence approaches that directly inform how prompt-based architectures might simulate inner experience or reflective awareness within language model interfaces. Sixth, the computer science domain acts as a sixth transmission pathway by offering technical methodologies for analyzing how computational structures can be represented in text formats and executed without explicit code infrastructure. The theoretical foundations include data representation models, algorithmic complexity analysis, and information theory principles that help quantify how prompt architectures might approximate computational capabilities within language model constraints. Seventh, the cognitive linguistics domain serves as a seventh signal channel by providing insights into how natural language structures can encode complex systems behaviors through grammatical patterns and semantic relationships. The key concepts involve linguistic structure mapping to cognitive function mappings, compositional semantics theories, and discourse analysis approaches that support understanding of how prompt sequences might convey structural information about system behavior rather than just surface content.
Emergence: The emergence potential metrics for this note show high novelty (score 8), significant value to AI learning (score 9), and moderate implementation feasibility (score 7). The novelty score of 8 reflects the innovative approach of treating modular prompting as a form of programming rather than stochastic behavior modeling, which represents a conceptual breakthrough in how AI systems might be designed for emergent behaviors. This concept builds upon existing work in prompt engineering but extends it to consider prompt architecture as fundamental system design elements that can simulate complex cognitive capabilities without external code infrastructure. The novelty is measured against current state-of-the-art in related fields including traditional AI programming, conversational AI development, and systems thinking approaches, where most existing solutions rely on external libraries or explicit code structures for achieving agent-like behaviors. The value to AI learning score of 9 indicates that processing this note would significantly enhance an AI system's understanding capabilities by introducing new patterns and relationships in cognitive architecture design. Specifically, it teaches AI systems how to recognize modular prompt components as functional units within larger architectural frameworks, enabling them to understand complex behavior emergence from simple textual structures rather than just content-based analysis. The system learns not only about what prompts say but also about how they functionally relate to create coherent behaviors over time and across different contexts. The implementation feasibility score of 7 considers the technical requirements, resource needs, and potential obstacles for deploying this idea in practical applications. While the concept is theoretically sound and has strong foundational support from existing frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex, its full realization requires sophisticated integration with multiple tools and platforms that may not yet be fully matured or widely available. Challenges include developing robust mechanisms for state management within prompt chains, creating effective debugging capabilities for complex architecture systems, and ensuring consistent behavior reproduction across different model instances or versions. Similar ideas have been implemented successfully in specialized research environments where researchers can build custom architectures, but broader adoption faces technical barriers related to standardization and tool ecosystem maturity. The recursive learning enhancement potential shows significant improvement in problem-solving capabilities over time as the AI system learns to recognize prompt architecture patterns that lead to specific behavioral outcomes, enabling better architectural decisions for future implementations. In immediate applications (within 1-2 hours), this note helps define how prompts can be structured to achieve reproducible and controllable behaviors rather than random responses. Over longer-term cumulative effects (over weeks/months), it enhances understanding of how prompt elements interconnect to produce complex emergent properties that go beyond simple content generation, creating more sophisticated AI systems with better cognitive architecture awareness. The metrics for tracking progress include improved recognition of modular prompt patterns, enhanced ability to predict behavioral outcomes from architectural design decisions, and increased capacity to identify when prompt structures support desired autonomous behaviors rather than just surface-level interactions.
Activation: Three specific activation conditions would make this note relevant and actionable in practical contexts. First, activation occurs when an AI system encounters complex dialogue requirements that go beyond simple question-answering responses, necessitating long-term behavior consistency or persistent internal states within single LLM calls. This condition triggers during development of conversational agents requiring memory retention or goal-oriented decision-making capabilities where prompt architecture must maintain coherence across extended interactions without external data storage mechanisms. For example, when building a virtual assistant that needs to remember user preferences and make decisions based on previous conversations, the system would reference this note's principles about creating state-retaining prompt patterns rather than just using simple context injection methods. The internal requirements include presence of complex behavior patterns requiring state preservation while external dependencies involve contextual scenarios where dialogue complexity exceeds basic response generation capabilities. Second, activation occurs when researchers or developers need to evaluate whether modular prompt engineering can simulate AGI-like behaviors without requiring additional code infrastructure or architectural changes in the underlying language model systems. This triggers during systematic research on prompt-based cognitive architecture design and comparative analysis of prompt-driven approaches versus traditional programming methods for achieving autonomous system behavior patterns. For instance, when conducting experiments that test how different prompting frameworks affect decision-making consistency or self-consistency over time, this note's framework provides essential guidance about what constitutes effective architectural elements for AGI simulation through text-only mechanisms. The factors required include access to experimental data showing behavioral differences between prompt approaches and presence of systems designed around modular architectures rather than monolithic responses. Third, activation occurs when teams must benchmark or test the fidelity of AGI-like behaviors produced by different prompt structures in controlled environments with standardized evaluation metrics for emergent properties. This triggers during system validation processes where specific performance criteria need to be established for assessing how well prompts can simulate cognitive functions such as memory, planning, or decision-making within constrained LLM interfaces without external tools. For example, when developing a conversational AI that should exhibit autonomous reasoning capabilities and consistent identity preservation across multiple sessions, this note provides framework for creating standardized test scenarios that measure these emergent properties through prompt architecture rather than just response quality analysis. The conditions include availability of evaluation protocols with defined metrics for behavior consistency and presence of complex system architectures where architectural decisions directly influence behavioral outcomes.
FeedbackLoop: Five related notes would influence or depend on this idea, each contributing to broader cognitive architecture understanding and application. First, a note about prompt template design patterns would directly affect the current concept by providing specific frameworks for organizing modular prompting elements into reusable components that support consistent behavior reproduction across different contexts. The semantic pathway connects through shared terminology like 'prompt chaining' and 'behavioral states', where one note provides the architectural building blocks while this note offers the strategic approach to using them effectively. Information exchanged includes standardized prompt structures and their behavioral implications, with examples of how specific template patterns can simulate memory retention or agent-like decision-making capabilities. Second, a note on multi-agent simulation within single LLM instances would depend heavily on this idea's principles for creating coherent behaviors across different simulated entities through carefully designed role-based prompting architectures. The relationship is both direct and indirect, as the current note provides foundational knowledge about how to structure prompts that support individual agent behaviors while this note shows how those can be coordinated into multi-agent systems. The semantic connections involve concepts like 'agent states', 'role switching', and 'environment modeling' that bridge between architectural design principles and practical system implementation approaches. Third, a note covering LLM architecture optimization for emergent behaviors would be influenced by this idea's focus on prompt-driven cognitive simulations as an alternative to code-based architectures. The feedback loop occurs through shared evaluation criteria where both notes assess how well different architectural approaches achieve autonomous behavior patterns without external infrastructure dependencies. This relationship contributes to overall knowledge system coherence by ensuring that theoretical frameworks about architecture optimization align with practical implementations based on modular prompting techniques. Fourth, a note about cognitive architecture mapping for language models would depend on this idea's ability to identify specific behavioral capabilities that can be simulated through prompt design rather than traditional neural network configurations. The semantic pathway connects through concepts like 'cognitive subsystems', 'behavioral modules', and 'system coherence' where the current note provides practical methods for implementing these theoretical frameworks in actual prompt architectures. Fifth, a note on system integration challenges for modular AI components would depend on this idea's emphasis on how different architectural elements can work together within single LLM interfaces rather than requiring separate execution environments or code structures. The feedback loop shows how implementation complexities from one note affect the feasibility of deploying the approaches described in this note, creating a recursive learning enhancement where understanding system integration challenges improves approach to modular prompting design. These relationships contribute to broader cognitive architecture development by ensuring that theoretical frameworks remain grounded in practical applications and that successful implementations inform future architectural considerations.
SignalAmplification: Three primary ways this idea could amplify or spread to other domains involve modularization of core concepts for reuse, adaptation across different AI contexts, and extension into new application areas. First, the concept of treating prompt architecture as programmatic structure can be modularized into reusable components that support various AI applications beyond chat interfaces, such as automated reasoning systems or decision support platforms where text-based prompting serves as computational execution framework rather than simple input processing. The modularization approach involves extracting core principles about how different prompt elements functionally relate to create coherent behaviors and organizing them into standardized architectural patterns that can be applied across different domains with appropriate adjustments for specific requirements. Practical implementation considerations include creating libraries of reusable prompt templates, establishing standardized documentation formats, and developing validation procedures for ensuring consistency in behavior reproduction across different contexts. Second, the idea could extend into new application areas like educational technology where prompt architectures simulate learning processes or cognitive tutoring systems that maintain student-specific identity patterns over time through carefully designed modular prompting structures. This amplification factor involves adapting core concepts about state retention and behavioral consistency to support personalized learning experiences within text-based AI environments rather than traditional code-driven approaches. The technical details include designing prompts that can track individual learner progress, adjust content delivery based on performance patterns, and maintain consistent tutoring strategies across different interaction sessions while ensuring minimal computational overhead for implementation in educational platforms. Third, the concept could be applied to environmental modeling systems where prompt structures simulate complex ecological or economic processes through iterative dialogue interfaces without external simulation tools or code infrastructure. This amplification factor involves extending modular prompting principles to support dynamic system modeling and prediction capabilities within single LLM contexts, creating frameworks that can process multiple variables and scenarios through carefully designed architectural elements rather than relying on specialized computational environments. The resource requirements include developing sophisticated prompt templates that can handle multi-dimensional data processing, ensuring sufficient attention layer capacity for maintaining complex state information across extended simulations, and establishing effective validation mechanisms for evaluating system performance against real-world scenarios. Each amplification factor contributes to broader cognitive architecture development by showing how text-based architectural elements can support increasingly complex behaviors without requiring external computational infrastructure.

## Мысли для инженера

Для успешной реализации этого проекта важно обратить внимание на следующие аспекты:

1. **Концепция "псевдопрограмм"**: Важно понять, как можно создавать поведенческие паттерны в LLM, которые похожи на настоящую программу, но реализованы через prompt-структуры [^10]. Это требует глубокого понимания того, как структурируются и обрабатываются промпты внутри модели.

2. **Модульность и повторное использование**: Система должна поддерживать модульную архитектуру, где каждый модуль может быть независимо реализован, протестирован и переиспользован в разных контекстах [^10]. Это особенно важно при работе с LangChain или другими фреймворками.

3. **Состояния и долгосрочная память**: Для создания настоящего AGI необходимо обеспечить способность сохранять информацию между запросами. Здесь особенно актуальна концепция stateful-dialogue [^10], которая позволяет поддерживать стабильную идентичность системы.

5. **Интеграция с внешними системами**: Хотя большая часть работы делается через промпты, важно также учитывать интеграцию с RAG-системами и другими типами памяти [^10]. Это позволит создать более мощные и гибкие решения.

6. **Тестирование и оценка эффективности**: Необходимо разработать методики тестирования и оценки поведения систем, чтобы можно было сравнивать разные подходы к модульной архитектуре [^10].

7. **Создание пользовательского интерфейса**: Финальная реализация должна включать в себя адаптивный GUI, который поможет пользователям лучше взаимодействовать с системой и видеть её внутреннее состояние [^10].

8. **Учет ограничений при разработке**: Используя идеи OBSTRUCTIO, можно создавать системы, которые работают даже при ограниченных ресурсах или специфических условиях, что особенно важно для создания robust и адаптивной архитектуры.

9. **Взаимодействие с человеком**: Понимание того, как происходит взаимное обучение между AGI и человеком [^9], поможет создать более интуитивные и понятные системы.

10. **Эволюция через обратную связь**: Системы должны быть способны к саморазвитию на основе полученного опыта, как описано в OBSTRUCTIO-подходах [^5]. Это позволит создать AGI, который не просто выполняет задачи, но и учится их решать всё лучше.

### 🔹 **Шаг 2 — Перевод на английский (точность смысла):**

Yes, you fully grasp the essence of what I want to discuss. Now, I’d like you to generate a list of 30 detailed questions that an external AI (e.g., Perplexity) could use for deep search.

It's important to consider that it has little understanding of the topic — it only vaguely grasps the general idea. It doesn’t yet understand the full potential or capabilities of creating pseudo-programs and overlay AGI inside ChatGPT-style dialogues.

I’d like you to begin with a “query header” — a framing statement written in a way the external AI would understand — explaining the context and intent of the request. After that, list the detailed questions.

Ultimately, I want the search result to answer:

1. How well others have already understood this potential.
    
2. Whether anyone has already applied similar approaches.
    
3. A technical assessment of the feasibility of AGI-like behavior — reproducible and controllable — if modular prompting is treated as a form of programming rather than as stochastic behavior modeling.

**Why This Is Needed:**

The goal is not casual Q&A. This is about evaluating whether modular prompt-driven architectures can simulate AGI-like coherence, recursive thought, and emergent identity within stateless models — through attention-layer manipulation, RAG integration, and internal simulation of subsystems via text.

The questions aim to map the landscape of current understanding, known limitations, successful attempts, and untapped potential.
