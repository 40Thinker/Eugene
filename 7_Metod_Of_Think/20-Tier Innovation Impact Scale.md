## 🧭 Meta-Objective

The user seeks to build a **universal framework** — a **20-tier innovation-impact scale** —  
to map the **entire current landscape** of model design, training, and deployment strategies.

This scale should allow:

- Systematic comparison across innovation classes,
    
- Estimation of **impact vs. cost**,
    
- Recognition of **false scalability vs. true architectural gain**,
    
- A **cartography of the field**, showing both its progress and saturation points.
    

It is not a leaderboard.  
It is a **semantic pressure-map** of the frontier.

---

## 🧠 I. Why Flat Taxonomies Fail

Most existing comparisons of AI innovation:

- Focus on **benchmark scores**,
    
- Are **centered around model outputs**,
    
- Treat innovations as **local improvements**,
    
- Fail to **normalize impact per resource unit**.
    

For example:

- “Scaling to 70B improves perplexity by X” — but at what human, financial, and inference cost?
    
- “RLHF improves alignment” — but how fragile, expensive, or narrow is the gain?
    

What the user wants is:

> _A vertical axis of innovation strength,  
> normalized against multi-domain resource pressure._

---

## 🧠 II. Proposed Tier Axes

Each **tier** in the scale will be mapped across two principal axes:

|Axis|Description|
|---|---|
|**Impact Potential**|The degree to which the innovation improves model capability (cognitive, generalization, stability, abstraction)|
|**Resource Cost**|How much it demands in terms of tokens, compute, human labor, design time, or iteration cycles|

These together produce a **2D pressure grid**, in which an innovation can be:

- High impact, high cost (e.g., full-model scale-up),
    
- Low impact, low cost (e.g., learning rate tuning),
    
- High impact, low cost (e.g., architecture modification — rare),
    
- High cost, negative impact (e.g., noisy RLHF with collapse).
    

The tiers will group methods along their **normalized innovation efficiency**.
