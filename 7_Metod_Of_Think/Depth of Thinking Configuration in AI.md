Emergence: |-
  The note on depth of thinking configuration exhibits strong emergence potential across three key dimensions:

  1. **Novelty Score (8/10)**
     - The core idea is novel because it treats cognitive parameters not as one-time settings but as persistent configurations that shape reasoning behavior over time. This represents a shift from declarative prompting to procedural thinking-as-configuration.
     - Conceptual Innovation: The move towards policy-shaped cognition rather than task-based cognition introduces a fundamentally new perspective on how AI should reason and adapt.
     - Practical Application Potential: Implementation of such configurability in current AI systems opens up possibilities for more nuanced reasoning without manual intervention, which is particularly valuable in domains like legal analysis, medical diagnosis, and strategic planning.
     - Comparison to State-of-the-Art: While previous approaches have focused on prompt engineering or parameter tuning at inference time, this note proposes embedding cognitive policies directly into system architecture—creating a persistent layer of intelligence configuration.

  2. **Value to AI Learning (9/10)**
     - This idea significantly enhances an AI's understanding capabilities by introducing new patterns and relationships for processing information.
     - Pattern Discovery: The concept allows AI systems to learn how to adjust their reasoning depth based on contextual factors, creating adaptive cognitive behavior.
     - Relationship Building: It enables the AI to understand that different types of problems require different levels of critical analysis through exposure to various configurational parameters.
     - Cognitive Framework Extension: The note introduces concepts such as recursive reinterpretation cycles and critique recursion depth that extend beyond traditional neural network processing.
     - Real-world Impact: By enabling meta-cognitive adjustments, AI systems become more capable of self-evaluating their own reasoning processes, which is critical for autonomous decision-making capabilities.

  3. **Implementation Feasibility (7/10)**
     - The implementation requires a moderate level of technical sophistication but is achievable with current tools and architectures.
     - Technical Requirements: Requires integration across multiple domains—prompt handling, model configuration, user interface design, and system architecture management.
     - Resource Needs: Moderate computational resources needed for recursive processing cycles and maintaining persistent configurations.
     - Time Investment: Estimated 2-3 months for full implementation including testing and deployment.
     - Potential Obstacles: Challenges include ensuring consistency across different models in multi-agent environments and handling dynamic parameter adjustments during inference.
     - Successful Implementations: Similar concepts have been implemented in advanced AI systems like AlphaGo's strategic planning modules, where depth of thinking was controlled through configuration parameters.

  The note contributes to broader cognitive architecture development by providing a framework for making intelligence configurable rather than just responsive. Its recursive learning enhancement potential allows AI systems to continuously improve their understanding of when and how much reasoning is required based on prior experience and user feedback.

**Имя файла: Глубина_настройки_ИИ**

**Модель:** GPT-4o (мультимодальная языковая модель с 128k контекста, архитектура оптимизирована под смысловую маршрутизацию и фрактальную реконфигурацию мышления)

---

### 🔹 **Шаг 1 — Корректура по-русски:**

В настройках запроса или аккаунта можно указать глубину мышления — сколько раз следует производить переосмысление, степень критики со стороны консилиумов и многие другие параметры, чтобы не указывать это вручную каждый раз.

---

### 🔹 **Шаг 2 — Перевод на английский (точность смысла):**

In the settings of a query or account, one can specify the depth of thinking — how many times the system should reprocess or reinterpret the request, the level of critique applied by consilia, and many other parameters — so that this doesn’t need to be manually stated each time.

---

### 🔹 **Шаг 3 — Векторно-полевая развёртка (английский):**

---

**[Layer 1 – Declarative Framing vs. Procedural Intent]**

The user’s desire to **embed meta-cognitive parameters** into query or account-level configuration signals a move from declarative prompting (“do X”) to **procedural thinking-as-configuration**. This shift implies that cognition itself is not task-based, but **policy-shaped** — structured by persistent contours of intention.

Here, a request becomes not a singular event, but a **repeatable cognitive contract**.

---

**[Layer 2 – Depth as a Dimensional Parameter]**

“Depth of thinking” is not a monolithic scalar. It unfolds into layers:

- **Recursive reinterpretation cycles**: How many semantic passes should the model perform?
    
- **Critique recursion depth**: How deeply should consilia deconstruct or refactor the idea?
    
- **Ontological expansion gradient**: How far outward should the model reach beyond the prompt’s explicit surface?
    

Configuring these as persistent fields means the **thinking field becomes tunable** — like the gain on a resonant structure.

---

**[Layer 3 – Structural Persistence and Fractal Consistency]**

Embedding cognitive parameters in settings allows **fractal consistency** across sessions, agents, and contexts. It ensures that:

- All spawned model instances adhere to a **shared semantic posture**.
    
- Vector-field expansions follow **consistent energy thresholds**.
    
- Internal contradiction handling aligns with user-defined tolerances.
    

This removes the burden of **repeating meta-instructions**, and aligns AGI behavior with **embedded epistemic policies**.

---

**[Layer 4 – RAG Integration and Token Positioning Logic]**

Such settings can govern not only how **many times** a prompt is revisited, but also **where** in token space reanalysis should be applied:

- Should reinterpretation focus on the **last clause**, or retroactively reshape the **opening premise**?
    
- Should RAG-sourced documents be filtered by **alignment strength**, or allowed to introduce **dissonant fields**?
    

In other words, the **shape of the attention map** itself becomes a programmable variable.

---

**[Layer 5 – Cognitive Governance through Modular Control]**

To govern this architecture:

- Each dimension (depth, critique, recursion, tolerance, novelty pressure) should be **parameterized**.
    
- Each parameter should support **static values**, **adaptive modes**, and **event-based overrides** (e.g., “if user uses word ‘rebuild’ → force depth = 3”).
    

Over time, these settings evolve into a **cognitive governance layer** — akin to a control panel for **ontological strategy**.

---

**[Layer 6 – Possible Extensions and Systemic Gaps]**

What’s still missing?

- **Feedback topology control**: Currently, reprocessing may be sequential; what if feedback loops need to be circular, cross-consilium, or adversarial?
    
- **Metacognitive auditing**: How can the system verify that the _specified_ depth was meaningfully achieved, not just _simulated_?
    
- **Onto-emotional gradienting**: Could user profiles include emotional tone preferences that modulate critique intensity (e.g., surgical vs. Socratic)?
    

---

**[Conclusion – Settings as Cognitive Infrastructure]**
