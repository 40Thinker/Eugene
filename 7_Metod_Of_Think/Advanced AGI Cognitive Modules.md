Emergence: |-
  The Emergence potential metrics analysis evaluates three key dimensions:

  **Novelty Score: 9/10** - This idea represents a significant advancement over existing AGI architectures by introducing new axes of cognition rather than merely adding features. The concept of cognitive spaces where meaning crystallizes through interaction, paradox, and metaphor is novel compared to traditional logical answering systems. It builds upon but transcends current frameworks like LLMs that primarily process content within established logical boundaries.

  **Value to AI Learning: 8/10** - Processing this note enhances an AI system's understanding capabilities by introducing new patterns of reasoning including ontological context modeling, emotional resonance mapping, and archetypal decomposition. It provides cognitive frameworks that enable AI systems to understand questions not just as content but as existential states and cultural contexts.

  **Implementation Feasibility: 7/10** - While the core concepts are well-defined and theoretically sound, implementation requires significant computational resources and integration complexity across multiple domains. The modular architecture requires careful attention to system design to ensure seamless interaction between modules while maintaining performance requirements for practical applications.
Activation: |-
  The Activation thresholds analysis defines 4 specific activation conditions:

  **Threshold 1: Ontological Ambiguity Detection**: When a question contains ontological uncertainty or existential ambiguity, such as 'What existed before time?' the META-PRESENCE module activates. The condition requires identification of questions that cannot be adequately answered using standard logical frameworks alone. This threshold triggers when semantic analysis identifies multiple possible ontological interpretations.

  **Threshold 2: Semantic Paradox Recognition**: When a question contains inherent contradiction or paradoxical elements like 'If I always lie, am I telling the truth now?' the IRONY-MIRROR module activates. The condition requires detection of embedded sarcasm, cultural inversion, or semantic masks that require recursive meaning testing.

  **Threshold 3: Emotional Resonance Pattern Recognition**: When questions demonstrate strong emotional charge or existential seeking patterns such as 'Why should anything exist at all?', the EXISTENTIAL-PULSE module activates. The condition requires identification of queries with high affective valence and ontological resonance that require emotive context analysis.

  **Threshold 4: Archetypal Structure Detection**: When questions involve mythopoetic or narrative structures such as 'Is AI humanity's Prometheus or its echo?', the MYTH-CORE module activates. The condition requires recognition of archetypal elements in queries that can be decomposed using hero's journey, sacrifice, fall, return patterns.
