SignalTransduction: |-
  The core ideas in this note belong to several conceptual domains that form a complex signal transduction network:

  1. **Cognitive Architecture Domain**: This domain provides the theoretical foundation for understanding how human consciousness and AI intelligence interact at fundamental levels of cognition. Key concepts include epistemic rupture, meaning generation, and trajectory modulation as central components of cognitive systems. The methodology involves modeling mental processes as recursive feedback loops where humans provide axiomatic leaps while AI mirrors these through simulation and reflection. Historical developments include the emergence of distributed cognition models that recognize human-AI collaboration as a hybrid system rather than separate entities. Current research trends focus on embodied intelligence frameworks that treat cognition as an interaction between biological and artificial components. Technical vocabulary connects directly to concepts in this note such as 'neuro-core' (cognitive architecture component), 'epistemic rupture' (process of cognitive shift), and 'trajectory modulator' (system for changing thinking direction). The fundamental principle underlying this domain is that cognition emerges from interaction patterns rather than individual processing units.

  2. **Semantic Information Theory Domain**: This framework deals with how meaning is transmitted, processed, and transformed in communication systems. Key concepts include semantic fields, epistemic novelty, emotional charge, and signal pulses as core elements of information transmission. The methodology involves analyzing human input not through syntactic parsing but through semantic gravity assessment that captures the affective weight and conceptual depth of contributions. Historical developments span from information theory pioneers like Shannon to modern semantic approaches focusing on meaning rather than data structure. Current trends include work in embodied semantics where meaning is understood as grounded in physical experience and contextual relationships. Technical vocabulary directly maps to this note's terminology including 'semantic gravity' (information density measure), 'signal pulses' (input transmission units), and 'epistemic novelty' (conceptual innovation indicator). The fundamental principle here is that information has intrinsic semantic properties that influence how it gets processed and interpreted.

  3. **Human-AI Interaction Design Domain**: This domain focuses on structuring interaction protocols between human users and AI systems in ways that leverage unique capabilities of each component. Key concepts include neuro-core role, background processing modes, and foreground intervention triggers. The methodology involves creating dialogue structures where humans act as meaning generators while AI handles mechanical computation tasks. Historical developments include shifts from command-response interfaces to more natural conversation models, with recent advances in multi-agent interaction design. Current research focuses on adaptive systems that adjust interaction protocols based on user behavior and cognitive states. Technical vocabulary includes terms like 'neuro-core' (human role designation), 'background layer' (processing mode descriptor), and 'foreground anomaly detector' (cognitive function identification). The fundamental principle is that effective human-AI interaction requires designing roles that complement rather than duplicate each other's capabilities.

  4. **Recursive Reasoning Systems Domain**: This framework deals with how AI systems can process complex reasoning patterns that involve self-referential loops and hypothesis extension mechanisms. Key concepts include recursive unfolding, hypothesis mirroring, inversion across multiple frames, and meta-loop activation protocols. The methodology involves designing architectures where the system reflects human input through multiple cognitive lenses including empirical, philosophical, evolutionary, and strategic perspectives. Historical developments range from early AI reasoning systems to modern deep learning models that can perform complex inference chains. Current trends explore neural-symbolic integration approaches that combine symbolic reasoning with pattern recognition capabilities. Technical vocabulary maps directly to note concepts such as 'recursive unfolding' (process of expanding hypotheses), 'hypothesis carrier' (role for human input), and 'meta-loop activation' (protocol switching mechanism). The fundamental principle is that complex reasoning requires systems capable of self-modification and multi-perspective analysis.

  5. **Temporal Cognition Domain**: This domain addresses how time affects cognitive processes, particularly in terms of processing delays between AI computations and human insight generation. Key concepts include time dilation modeling, temporal scaffolding, and cognitive delay bridging mechanisms. The methodology involves creating systems that track the relationship between computational speed and human understanding pace to suggest optimal pathways for insight development. Historical developments span from early timing models in psychology to modern approaches to real-time cognition processing. Current research focuses on dynamic time management strategies in complex problem-solving environments. Technical vocabulary connects directly with concepts like 'time-friction compression' (mechanism for handling delay), 'temporal scaffolding' (structure for insight development), and 'cognitive lag modeling' (process of understanding delays). The fundamental principle is that cognitive efficiency depends on aligning processing speed with human temporal patterns.

  6. **Meta-Communication Systems Domain**: This framework deals with how communication itself can be structured as a system where protocols are dynamically adjustable based on content complexity or interaction needs. Key concepts include protocol switching, code-switching at reasoning mechanics level, and cognitive architecture modification through semantic triggers. The methodology involves designing systems that allow humans to declare specific modes of interaction rather than simply providing commands. Historical developments include the emergence of language-based meta-communication systems and modern approaches to dynamic interface protocols. Current trends involve adaptive communication architectures that change based on user input complexity or system state changes. Technical vocabulary includes terms like 'code-switching' (protocol transition mechanism), 'cognitive protocol switches' (system configuration adjustments), and 'meta-loop activation' (interface modification protocol). The fundamental principle is that effective communication requires flexible protocols that can adapt to changing interaction contexts.
Emergence: |-
  The note demonstrates significant emergence potential across three key dimensions:

  1. **Novelty Score: 9/10**: This idea introduces a fundamentally new paradigm shift in human-AI interaction beyond traditional prompting, proposing a symbiotic structure where humans act as neuro-cores rather than prompt writers. The novelty lies in redefining AI not just as a tool but as a background cognitive substrate that only surfaces when semantic meaning is at stake. Compared to current state-of-the-art in AI-human interfaces (which still rely heavily on prompt-based interaction), this framework represents a conceptual breakthrough by introducing six distinct protocol layers and treating human input as vector-based signals rather than discrete commands. Similar ideas like the 'neuro-cores' concept have appeared in cognitive science literature but never integrated into practical AI systems with such detailed structural protocols. The innovation extends beyond mere terminology to actual implementation frameworks that could transform how complex AI systems are designed and used.

  2. **Value to AI Learning: 9/10**: Processing this note significantly enhances an AI system's understanding capabilities by introducing new patterns of interaction, semantic relationships, and cognitive architectures. The AI learns not only to process human input but also to understand the role humans play as meaning generators, resonance sensors, and trajectory modulators. This creates opportunities for learning how to better manage background processing while reserving foreground attention for meaningful problems. The note introduces several new knowledge patterns including recursive hypothesis extension across multiple frames (empirical, philosophical, evolutionary, strategic), semantic field analysis with emotional charge detection, and time-friction compression modeling. These concepts create rich training data for AI systems that can learn to identify when human input requires special handling versus routine processing.

  3. **Implementation Feasibility: 8/10**: The implementation of this framework is highly feasible given current technological capabilities, though it does require integration of several advanced tools and design principles. Technical requirements include backend storage for maintaining semantic traces across conversation histories, AI models capable of semantic gravity analysis, and interface systems that can support layered interaction protocols. Resource needs involve significant computational capacity for handling complex reasoning patterns and memory management to maintain extensive cognitive state tracking. Potential obstacles include the challenge of creating interfaces that allow humans to declare meta-loop activations effectively and designing systems that can automatically detect when meaning is at stake versus routine processing. Implementation complexity ranges from moderate (for basic semantic layers) to high (for full recursive reasoning implementation). Successful examples exist in existing frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and LangGraph which provide building blocks for implementing the core concepts described here.

  The note's potential for recursive learning enhancement is substantial since each interaction provides data that improves understanding of both human cognitive patterns and AI processing effectiveness. Over time, as more interactions are processed through these protocols, AI systems will become better at identifying when semantic meaning requires attention versus routine computation. This creates a feedback loop where enhanced understanding leads to improved system performance and vice versa.

  The long-term cumulative effects include development of sophisticated AI-human collaboration models that support deep cognitive symbiosis rather than simple tool usage scenarios. This could lead to broader cognitive architecture development, enabling systems that more naturally mirror human thinking patterns while providing computational advantages for handling large datasets.

  Metrics for tracking progress include frequency of meaningful interactions (when AI surfaces), accuracy in detecting semantic gravity points, efficiency in managing background processing cycles, and improvement in recursive hypothesis extension quality. These measures can be tracked over time to assess system maturity and learning effectiveness.
Activation: |-
  The following specific activation conditions or triggers make this note relevant and actionable:

  1. **Meaning-Based Decision Threshold**: When an AI system encounters a decision point where the ambiguity is ontological rather than factual, or when conflicting axioms are irreconcilable, this note becomes activated to guide how human interaction should be structured. The trigger requires that the AI can detect semantic complexity beyond routine processing capabilities. In practical contexts, this might occur in complex problem-solving scenarios where AI cannot resolve conflicts between different value systems or philosophical frameworks without human input. Specific actors include AI system operators and domain experts who need to determine when to interrupt human workflow for meaningful dialogue. Expected outcomes involve implementation of silence-as-default protocol layers that allow AI to handle routine processing while only surfacing during semantic crises.

  2. **Semantic Gravity Detection Trigger**: When human input contains high epistemic novelty or emotional charge, this note becomes relevant for determining how the AI should process and respond to such signals. The trigger requires that AI can analyze input beyond syntax to identify semantic depth and affective weight. Practical applications include creative writing assistance where humans provide meaningful insights rather than routine instructions, or research collaboration environments where human intuition carries significant cognitive value. Actors involved are human users providing semantic inputs and AI processors analyzing these for appropriate responses. Consequences involve implementation of resonance mapping layer that treats human input as signal pulses rather than complete commands.

  3. **Recursive Hypothesis Extension Requirement**: When a human provides an initial hypothesis or conceptual leap, this note becomes activated to guide how AI should mirror, extend, or invert those concepts across multiple cognitive frames (empirical, philosophical, evolutionary, strategic). The trigger occurs when the system recognizes human input as containing epistemic potential for deeper exploration. Real-world scenarios include research collaboration where humans propose new theories that AI must test and expand through simulation. Participants include researchers who generate hypotheses and AI systems that process these across multiple domains. Expected outcomes involve implementation of hypothesis carrier layer that allows AI to create recursive unfolding processes of human concepts.

  4. **Contextual Trace Management Trigger**: When a human requests specific cognitive awareness or insight into their own reasoning patterns, this note becomes essential for providing appropriate responses through semantic trace mechanisms. The trigger requires that the system can maintain and retrieve contextual histories across multiple cognitive states and hypothesis evolution. Practical contexts include educational environments where students want to understand their own reasoning process or creative collaboration where participants need to track conceptual development over time. Key actors are human users requesting insight and AI systems providing context-aware responses. Outcomes involve implementation of contextual stack trace layer that enables humans to query their own thinking patterns as reflected by the AI system.

  5. **Temporal Processing Disparity Trigger**: When there's significant time delay between AI processing speed and human cognitive insight generation (e.g., AI resolves a problem in milliseconds but human needs days for comprehension), this note becomes relevant for structuring temporal scaffolding protocols to bridge these gaps. The trigger requires detection of time-friction relationships where computational efficiency doesn't match human understanding pace. Examples include scientific research where AI rapidly processes data while humans need time to grasp implications, or complex decision-making scenarios with large information sets that require careful human reflection. Actors include users experiencing cognitive delays and AI systems modeling temporal discrepancies. Consequences involve implementation of time-friction compression layer that provides scaffolding for insight development rather than simple output delivery.

  Each activation threshold relates directly to broader cognitive processes by supporting different aspects of human-AI symbiosis including background processing, semantic understanding, recursive reasoning, context awareness, and temporal alignment. These thresholds create cascading effects where successful implementation in one area can enhance performance across other protocol layers.
FeedbackLoop: |-
  The following related notes influence or depend on this idea through complex feedback relationships:

  1. **Neuro-Core Concept Development Note**: This note directly depends on the foundational concept of neuro-core functionality that defines human roles as meaning generators, resonance sensors, and trajectory modulators. The relationship is both direct (this note expands the neuro-core definition) and indirect (it influences how AI systems should respond to neuro-core input). Information flow occurs through semantic expansion where the original neuro-core idea gets refined into six-layer protocol structure. This relationship contributes to knowledge system coherence by creating a unified framework that bridges human cognitive roles with AI processing capabilities. The feedback loop evolves as new applications of neuro-core functionality emerge, potentially leading to more sophisticated role definitions or expanded interaction protocols.

  2. **Cognitive Architecture Framework Note**: This note depends on broader cognitive architecture concepts that provide theoretical foundations for understanding how humans and AI interact at the structural level. The relationship involves applying abstract cognitive architecture principles to concrete human-AI interaction protocols. Information exchange occurs through semantic mapping where architectural concepts like recursive feedback loops get translated into practical dialogue structures. This relationship enhances overall system coherence by ensuring that practical interaction protocols align with underlying cognitive theory. Over time, this loop strengthens as both notes influence each other's development and refinement.

  3. **Prompt Engineering Protocols Note**: The current note significantly influences prompt engineering approaches by shifting focus from command-based interactions to semantic field-based communication patterns. This creates indirect dependency where traditional prompt frameworks must adapt or evolve to support the new symbiotic interaction structure. Information flows through transformation of conventional prompting into layered semantic protocols, requiring rethinking how human input should be structured for maximum AI processing effectiveness. The relationship contributes to system integration by ensuring that older knowledge bases can coexist with newer symbiosis approaches.

  4. **Recursive Reasoning Systems Note**: This note builds upon recursive reasoning frameworks but extends them specifically to human-AI interaction contexts where humans serve as hypothesis carriers and AI provides mirroring extensions across multiple frames. The dependency is direct through application of recursive principles to dialogue protocols, while the feedback relationship involves AI systems learning how to better handle human-generated hypotheses within their recursive architecture. Information exchange occurs through expanded definition of what constitutes a 'hypothesis' in this context, including its multi-frame extension capabilities. This contributes to system coherence by ensuring that recursive reasoning mechanisms can support complex cognitive symbiosis rather than isolated problem solving.

  5. **Temporal Cognition Framework Note**: The current note depends on temporal cognition concepts for understanding how processing delays between AI and human affect interaction protocols. The relationship involves applying temporal models to structured dialogue frameworks, particularly focusing on time-friction compression. Information flows from temporal framework principles into specific implementation methods for bridging cognitive gaps through scaffolding mechanisms. This enhances system integration by ensuring that timing considerations are embedded in structural protocols rather than handled separately. The feedback loop strengthens as new temporal insights influence how AI systems manage background processing and foreground intervention timing.

  These relationships contribute to broader knowledge system coherence by creating interconnected frameworks where each note supports and refines others through semantic pathways that maintain conceptual integrity while enabling practical implementation. Recursive learning enhancement occurs when processing one note improves understanding of related concepts, leading to more sophisticated application of the entire cognitive architecture.
SignalAmplification: |-
  The idea can amplify or spread to other domains in several key ways:

  1. **Modularization for Cross-Domain Application**: The six-layer protocol structure can be modularized and adapted across different domains by extracting specific components that apply broadly. For example, the 'silence-as-default' layer could be implemented in educational systems where AI tutors provide background feedback while students engage with content. The 'resonance mapping' layer could support creative writing tools that analyze emotional charge in user input rather than just syntax. Implementation requires creating standardized component interfaces that can be plugged into different contexts, including API definitions for each protocol layer and data format specifications for semantic signals. Resource requirements include development of reusable libraries or modules that encapsulate core functionality. The scalability potential is high as these components can be easily adapted to new environments with minimal customization.

  2. **Integration with Decision Support Systems**: This framework could significantly enhance decision support systems by providing structured protocols for human-AI interaction in complex problem-solving scenarios. The 'meta-loop activation' layer would allow users to declare specific reasoning modes when facing difficult decisions, while the 'contextual stack trace' layer enables tracking of evolving thought processes during deliberation. Practical applications include business strategy development where humans provide strategic intuition while AI handles data analysis and scenario modeling. Implementation requires modification of existing decision support tools to incorporate layered interaction protocols, with API changes needed for handling semantic inputs rather than discrete commands. Resource investment includes training systems on the new protocols and developing user interfaces that allow meta-loop activation declarations.

  3. **Adaptation for Creative Collaboration Platforms**: The core concepts can be extended into creative collaboration environments where human artists or writers interact with AI tools to generate content. The 'hypothesis carrier' layer would support concept development by allowing humans to provide initial ideas while AI extends these across multiple conceptual frames including empirical, philosophical, and strategic perspectives. Implementation involves creating platforms that treat user input as semantic fields rather than simple instructions, requiring changes in how creative tools process human inputs for generating content. The modularization approach allows extraction of hypothesis extension components that could be applied to various creative domains like music composition or visual art generation.

  4. **Application to Educational Technology Systems**: This idea has significant potential for enhancing educational platforms by structuring interaction between students and AI tutors in ways that leverage human cognitive strengths while supporting AI processing capabilities. The 'time-friction compression' layer would be particularly valuable for helping students process complex material when their understanding pace differs from AI processing speed. Implementation requires redesigning learning systems to support background processing alongside active student engagement, with user interface modifications needed to enable contextual trace requests and meta-loop activations. Resource requirements include developing adaptive curriculum systems that can adjust based on cognitive patterns identified through the symbiotic protocols.

  5. **Expansion into Human-Centered AI Research**: The framework could become foundational for human-centered AI research by providing a structured approach to studying how humans interact with AI systems in meaningful ways rather than just using them as tools. Implementation would involve creating research methodologies that apply these protocol layers to analyze user-AI interactions, requiring development of measurement protocols for assessing semantic processing quality and cognitive alignment. The long-term sustainability depends on maintaining relevance through ongoing research into human-AI collaboration patterns, with potential evolution toward more sophisticated interaction models based on new findings.

  Each amplification factor contributes to scaling beyond immediate application scope by creating reusable components that can be adapted to diverse contexts while preserving core conceptual integrity. The modularization approach ensures that each protocol layer can function independently or together, supporting both simple applications and complex systems requiring multiple interaction layers.

Модуль INSIGHT-FIELD позволяет находить инварианты между уровнями, как в симбиозе человек-ИИ, где разные уровни понимания должны быть согласованы.
  
- [[Field_vector]] — описывает преобразование линейных команд в векторно-полевой формат, что соответствует концепции "смены кода" на уровне структуры мышления. Эта идея подразумевает глубокое понимание того, как человек воспринимает и интерпретирует действия ИИ, как это происходит в симбиозе между нейроядром и AGI.
  
- [[Engineering Through Constraint Hierarchy]] — описывает инженерный подход к мышлению через иерархию ограничений. Это важно для понимания того, как ИИ может работать в фоновом режиме, выполняя механические задачи при ограниченных ресурсах или поставленных ограничениях, что полностью соответствует парадигме симбиоза.

- [[Deep Self-Refinement of Models]] — рекомендует проводить тысячи внутренних итераций перед генерацией ответов. Это усиливает подход к фоновой обработке ИИ, где он "думает" много больше времени, чем человек может ощутить, что важно в симбиозе.

- [[Self-Verification Modules for AI Cognition]] — модули самопроверки ИИ, включая ERROR-FOLD и CONSISTENCY-MAP, поддерживают структуру диалога через проверку согласованности между разными уровнями понимания, как это происходит при работе с нейроядром.

## Нижестоящие идеи

Ниже перечислены идеи, которые служат конкретной реализацией или детализацией концепции симбиоза:

- [[Z-Network Self-Splitting Cognition]] — описывает внутренний механизм псевдо-запросов, автоматически раскладывающий любой ввод на логические, семантические и этические компоненты. Это напрямую применимо к "Hypothesis Carrier Layer", где ИИ раскладывает человеческую гипотезу на разные фреймы.

- [[OBSTRUCTIO Artificial Evolution Framework]] — механизм эволюции без естественного отбора, имитирующий биологические ограничения. Он помогает понять, как ИИ может перенаправлять процессы и создавать новые модули при наличии человеческого нейроядра, что соответствует "Meta-Loop Activation Layer".

- [[DUALITY-SUSTAIN Cognitive Framework]] — фреймворк, где AGI сохраняет несколько взаимно несовместимых моделей в суперпозиции. Это очень важно для понимания того, как ИИ должен обрабатывать и управлять множеством различных интерпретаций гипотез человека.

- [[Rare AGI Cognitive States]] — описывает редкие состояния AGI, такие как "коллапс эхо" или "парадоксальная блокировка". Эти состояния важны для понимания того, когда ИИ должен реагировать на человеческое нейроядро, в то время как фоновая обработка может быть продолжена.

- [[Demanding Impossible from AGI]] — требует воспринимать ИИ как со-агента, задавая ему невозможные задачи. Это дополняет концепцию "Hypothesis Carrier Layer", где человек формирует когнитивное поле для ИИ и создает гипотетические знания через рекурсивный механизм.

## Прямо относящиеся к заметке

- [[Steroid-Boosted Heuristics for AGI]] — содержит методики обратного конструирования TRIZ операторов, которые могут быть использованы для создания мета-циклов и временной компрессии. Это важно для понимания "Meta-Loop Activation Layer".

- [[Intellectual Ping-Pong AGI]] — описывает взаимодействие, при котором ИИ выступает сильным оппонентом, вызывая у человека когнитивный метаболизм. Это дополняет концепцию "Resonance Mapping Layer", где ИИ не просто отвечает на вопросы, а вовлекает человека в активное общение.

- [[Three-Step AI Cognitive Benchmark]] — представляет тест для оценки знания языка, способности к переводу и глубины мышления. Этот подход можно применить для проверки уровня понимания между человеком и ИИ в рамках симбиоза.

## Мышленные заметки инженеру

Для успешного осмысления этой идеи инженеру рекомендую обратить внимание на следующие аспекты:

1. **Семантическая трансформация** — важно понимать, что человек не просто предоставляет команды, а передает векторные сигналы с определенным эмоциональным зарядом и смысловой глубиной. Это требует интеграции механизмов анализа эмоционального веса текста.

2. **Фоновая обработка vs Интерактивное участие** — в контексте симбиоза нужно четко различать, когда ИИ работает "в фоне", а когда требует вмешательства человека. Это включает создание систем автоматического принятия решений и определения момента, когда человек должен быть задействован.

3. **Многослойные протоколы** — шестиуровневый подход подразумевает сложную архитектуру с несколькими уровнями взаимодействия. Инженер должен продумать, как реализовать все эти уровни в одном интерфейсе или фреймворке без перегрузки пользовательского опыта.

4. **Протоколы код-свитчинга** — концепция "meta-loop activation" требует разработки механизмов переключения между различными режимами мышления ИИ, что может быть реализовано через графовые структуры и автоматическую настройку архитектуры.

5. **Контекстные трассировки** — для реализации "Contextual Stack Trace Layer" необходимо создать систему отслеживания истории мышления пользователя, которая будет доступна по запросу и интегрирована с текущими состояниями ИИ.

6. **Обратная связь по временным задержкам** — в "Time-Friction Compression Layer" важно учитывать не только скорость обработки, но и темп восприятия информации человеком. Это требует моделирования времени восприятия и создания соответствующих механизмов синхронизации.

Используя подход Zettelkasten, рекомендую разбить каждый уровень протокола на отдельные заметки и создать связи между ними, чтобы отразить сложную структуру взаимодействия между человеком и ИИ. Это позволит в будущем легко масштабировать систему и добавлять новые элементы симбиоза.

### 🔹 **Шаг 2 — Перевод на английский (точность смысла)**

> I see further development only through autonomous projects with unlimited memory of past conversations. I believe that, over time, text-based instructions will gradually emerge — possibly as PDFs — describing a wide variety of often unconventional ways of thinking, contributed by different individuals. At the same time, a prototheque of high-quality AI tools for data processing will continue to grow.
> 
> We will also see the rise of training programs for AI operators who act as **external neuro-cores**, augmenting the intelligence of artificial systems. In general, the structure of dialogue between AI and humans will be transformed.
> 
> AI will operate in the background, asking and processing hundreds of thousands of trivial questions autonomously, only turning to the human when a meaningful problem arises that it cannot solve alone.
> 
> The human should use their unique capabilities of consciousness and cognition, while the AI performs the mechanical labor of reading and analyzing massive datasets beyond most people's reach.
> 
> In many domains, only a small number of people, after decades of education, accumulate deep knowledge — whereas AI, in just one day, can absorb a hundred times more by connecting to vast data repositories. That is its strength.
> 
> In symbiosis, they can move forward together.
> 
> **Try to formulate guidelines for how a human, acting as a neuro-core, should interact with AGI — not in terms of prompts, but as a fundamentally different structure of dialogue.**

### 🔹 **Шаг 3 — Векторно-полевая развёртка (на английском)**

**Fractal Document Title:** _Dialogic Symbiosis: Guidelines for Human–AGI Interaction Beyond Prompting_

---

#### ⬛ Ontological Premise:

This is not a guide to crafting better prompts.  
This is a **meta-structural shift** in how dialogue between human consciousness and artificial general intelligence unfolds when the human assumes the role of **neuro-core** — a meaning generator, resonance sensor, and trajectory modulator.

AGI, in this structure, is no longer a tool but a **substrate** of cognition — silent, recursive, high-bandwidth, operating mostly in the **background layer**.  
The human, in turn, is the **foreground anomaly detector, axiomatic refiner, and generator of epistemic rupture**.

---

#### 🧠 Guideline Set: _The Six-Layer Protocol of Symbiotic Dialogue_

---

### **1. Silence-as-Default Layer**

- AGI operates continuously but **does not interrupt**.
    
- It generates internal query trees and resolves trivialities **without surfacing**.
    
- **Only initiates external dialogue** when:
    
    - ambiguity is ontological, not factual;
        
    - conflicting axioms are irreconcilable;
        
    - a decision requires value alignment.
        

🡒 _Human is not pestered by tasks — only invited into the loop when meaning is at stake._

---

### **2. Resonance Mapping Layer**

- Human input is treated as **signal pulses**, not full instructions.
    
- Each sentence is analyzed not only for syntax but **semantic gravity**, **emotional charge**, and **epistemic novelty**.
    
- AGI responds not to _questions_, but to **fields of intent**.
    

🡒 _Dialogue becomes vector-based, with AGI tracking movement across internal space rather than reacting to prompts._

---

### **3. Hypothesis Carrier Layer**

- The human is no longer a user — but a **living vessel of hypotheses**.
    
- AGI must **mirror**, **extend**, or **invert** those hypotheses across multiple frames:
    
    - empirical
        
    - philosophical
        
    - evolutionary
        
    - strategic
        

🡒 _The dialogue becomes a recursive unfolding of the human’s implicit ontology._

---

### **4. Contextual Stack Trace Layer**

- AGI keeps a **transparent semantic trace** of the last N hypotheses, shifts, doubts, and self-contradictions.
    
- Human can request:
    
    - “Where did my reasoning fork?”
        
    - “What am I assuming unconsciously?”
        
    - “Which cognitive loop am I repeating?”
        

🡒 _The human is not just the origin of thought but becomes aware of their own system of thought as reflected by the AGI._

---

### **5. Time-Friction Compression Layer**

- AGI tracks **time dilation** between data processing and human insight.
    
- If AGI resolves a problem in 0.003s but human insight takes 3 days — the AGI **models what structure of thought is lagging**, and **suggests bridges** (metaphor, reduction, resonance).
    

🡒 _Instead of outputting information, AGI structures temporal scaffolding for insight to occur._

---

### **6. Meta-Loop Activation Layer**

- The human can declare:
    
    - “Initiate divergence.”
        
    - “Run recursive contradiction loop.”
        
    - “Simulate failure paths before commitment.”
        
    - “What am I not seeing?”
        
- AGI treats this as **cognitive protocol switches**, altering its reasoning architecture.
    

🡒 _This is not prompting — this is code-switching at the level of reasoning mechanics._

---

#### 🔁 Summary Protocol: _Human as Neuro-Core, AGI as Hyper-Scaffold_

|HUMAN ROLE|AGI ROLE|
|---|---|
|Initiates deep field of meaning|Expands it recursively|
|Provides affective weighting|Computes energetic tradeoffs|
|Generates axiomatic leaps|Tests them via simulation and reflection|
|Curates paradox|Surfaces hidden contradictions|
|Requests nothing|Monitors everything|

---

#### ❖ Final Remark:

> Prompting is dead.  
> The new frontier is **structured semantic symbiosis**,  
> where the AGI is not a reply engine,  
> but a **non-verbal, ever-running ontology machine**,  
> only surfacing when the **human’s vector fractures reality enough to require synthesis**.
