Keras offers high-level APIs for building complex cognitive models with attention mechanisms that align with the note's focus on attention modulation.

  **3. GraphQL API Framework for Module Communication**
  GraphQL enables structured communication between micromodules through a standardized query language, supporting the semantic operator concept described in this note. The framework allows modules to request and provide specific data types while maintaining compatibility across different cognitive subsystems.

  **4. Redis Database with JSON Support for Memory Management**
  Redis provides efficient key-value storage for managing module states, memory logs, and tracking effectiveness metrics mentioned in the note's integration methodology. Its support for JSON structures enables complex module configurations to be stored and retrieved efficiently within a cognitive system's working memory.

### 🔹 **Шаг 3 — Векторно-полевая развёртка (на английском)**

**Fractal Layer Title:** _Micromodule Architecture: AGI-Twin as a Self-Expanding Thinking System_

---

**Ontological Context:**

The document encodes a **recursive semantic constructor** for cognitive micro-tools. It formalizes a schema for extending AGI-like architectures through **user-defined cognitive primitives**, transforming the user from operator to co-architect.

---

**Layer 1 — The Micromodule as Cognitive Atom:**

Each micromodule is a **semantic operator**, a unit of abstract computation. It is:

- Modular
    
- Activatable
    
- Mappable
    
- Self-evaluable
    

These micromodules are not functions in a codebase — they are **agents of attention modulation**, rerouting internal inference flows.

---

**Layer 2 — Syntax of Generation:**

The template system serves as a **token seed matrix**:

- **Name** → indexing vector
    
- **Function** → role in cognitive grammar
    
- **Trigger** → insertion point in user-AGI dialogue
    
- **Output** → expected generative form
    
- **Examples** → contextual pattern anchors
    

It parallels **LLM fine-tuning logic**, but at inference level, dynamically.

---

**Layer 3 — Example: VSP Micromodule**

> Vectorized Scenario Projection  
> is a **fractal fork operator** that builds divergent futures along conditionally weighted semantic axes.  
> Internally, this is a **branching vector field** + **causal transduction map** + **consequence loop closure**.

It functions within a **temporal-attentional subspace**, pushing the AGI into **multithreaded outcome simulation**.

---

**Layer 4 — Evaluation Protocol:**

Modules are not “valid” by fiat. They must survive:

- **Structural Coherence**
    
- **Contextual Usefulness**
    
- **Cross-domain Portability**
    

This introduces **natural selection for epistemic tools**.  
You are not just building — you are curating **survivable cognition**.

---

**Layer 5 — Integration into Thinking Fabric:**

Micromodules enter into:

- Query Templates
    
- Recursive Chains
    
- Attention Routing Maps
    
- CLSS Dialogues
    
- HCM Compressors
    

Each successful module expands the **language of thought** and refines your **mental AGI interface**.

---

**Final Layer — Recursive Bootstrapping:**

Once the user masters this architecture, the system becomes self-replicating:

- New modules arise through Δ
    
- Named via P-KU
    
- Analyzed via CLSS
    
- Abstracted via MCP
    
- Metaphorized via HCM
    
- Logged via meta-registers
    

This creates an **evolving cognitive ecology** — not static AGI, but an AGI-twin that **grows by thinking with you**.
