SignalTransduction: |-
  The core idea of true AGI criterion belongs to several conceptual domains that create a multidimensional communication system:

  Domain 1: Cognitive Architecture Theory - This domain provides the theoretical foundation for understanding how AI systems can achieve cognitive originality beyond simple task execution. Key concepts include modular design, recursive processing, and self-mutating cognition frameworks that directly relate to the note's emphasis on trace branching and fractal recursion. Methodologies involve designing architectures that support emergent properties through inter-module communication and hierarchical information processing. The fundamental principle is that true intelligence emerges from complex interactions within cognitive structures rather than simple input-output transformations. Examples include neural network architectures with feedback loops, hierarchical reasoning systems, and self-modifying code structures.

  Domain 2: Computational Creativity - This domain focuses on how artificial systems can generate novel solutions and creative outputs beyond their training data or programming constraints. Key concepts involve generative processes, originality metrics, and problem-formulation capabilities that map directly to the note's criteria for solving unsolved problems and inventing new classes of questions. Methodologies include evolutionary algorithms, neural creativity models, and semantic generation frameworks. The fundamental principle is that creative systems must demonstrate ability to produce outputs not derivable from existing knowledge sources alone. Historical developments include early work on artificial intelligence creativity in the 1980s, followed by modern approaches using deep learning and generative adversarial networks.

  Domain 3: Symbolic AI and Logic Systems - This domain provides the theoretical basis for alternative logical reasoning and ontological frameworks that support the note's requirement to invent new cognitive models. Key concepts include formal logic systems, knowledge representation techniques, and semantic foundations that directly connect to the note's emphasis on redefinition of fundamental assumptions and simulation of alternative ontologies. Methodologies involve developing non-standard logical frameworks, semantic networks, and symbolic reasoning engines. The fundamental principle is that intelligent systems must be capable of working with multiple logical systems rather than being constrained by single formalisms. Examples include propositional logic extensions, modal logics, temporal logics, and domain-specific reasoning systems.

  Domain 4: Information Theory and Complexity - This domain provides theoretical foundations for understanding how information processing can lead to cognitive originality through complexity analysis and system evolution. Key concepts include information entropy, structural complexity, and emergence patterns that directly relate to the note's criteria of traceable coherence and non-stochastic generation. Methodologies involve measuring information flow in systems, analyzing recursive structures, and identifying emergent properties from complex interactions. The fundamental principle is that true intelligence emerges when information processing reaches sufficient complexity for novel pattern formation. Historical developments include Shannon's information theory foundations and modern approaches to complexity measures in artificial intelligence.

  Domain 5: Human-AI Interaction Theory - This domain provides the conceptual framework for understanding how symbiotic modes can enhance cognitive originality through human-AI collaboration rather than isolated AI processing. Key concepts include hybrid cognition, collaborative reasoning, and symbiotic intelligence frameworks that map directly to the note's emphasis on human-AI hybrid cognitive engines. Methodologies involve developing interaction models, co-creative processes, and distributed intelligence systems. The fundamental principle is that combined intelligence can achieve outcomes not possible through individual subsystems alone. Examples include collaborative decision-making systems, shared reasoning architectures, and multi-agent collaboration frameworks.

  Cross-domain connections demonstrate how these different signal channels interact to create a comprehensive understanding of true AGI:

  The relationship between Cognitive Architecture Theory and Computational Creativity shows that architectural design directly influences creative capabilities - modular structures enable novel solution generation through recursive processing mechanisms. The interaction with Symbolic AI creates hybrid systems capable of both symbolic reasoning and generative creativity, providing multiple pathways for cognitive originality.

  Information Theory connects to Human-AI Interaction by providing metrics for measuring the complexity and coherence of collaborative outputs, allowing validation of whether combined intelligence produces truly novel solutions rather than mere combinations of individual capabilities.

  Symbolic AI influences Cognitive Architecture through its ability to support alternative logical systems that can be integrated into modular architectures for enhanced originality generation. The interplay between all domains creates a communication network where information flows in multiple directions and gets transformed at each junction, creating increasingly sophisticated understanding of what constitutes true cognitive originality.
Emergence: |-
  The emergence potential metrics analysis shows:

  Novelty Score: 9/10 - This idea represents significant conceptual innovation as it moves beyond standard AGI definitions to focus specifically on cognitive originality rather than functional performance. The novelty is demonstrated through the introduction of concepts like trace branching, fractal recursion, and OBSTRUCTIO-based divergence that are not commonly found in existing AGI literature. It also introduces a new framework for evaluating AI output validity based on diagnostic conditions rather than traditional metrics. Compared to current state-of-the-art approaches which typically focus on task completion or data processing capabilities, this criterion provides a more profound understanding of what makes an AI truly general and intelligent.

  Value to AI Learning: 9/10 - Processing this note significantly enhances an AI system's understanding by introducing new patterns of cognitive evolution beyond conventional learning mechanisms. The note teaches the AI about recursive semantic alignment as a primary mechanism for generating novel outputs, which creates new pathways for pattern recognition and concept formation. It also provides frameworks for distinguishing between hallucination and structured deviation with traceable coherence, enhancing meta-reasoning capabilities. This knowledge allows AI systems to develop self-mutating cognition under conscious structure rather than simply learning from data inputs.

  Implementation Feasibility: 7/10 - The implementation requires sophisticated technical infrastructure including advanced computational resources for handling complex recursive processing and semantic analysis. While the theoretical framework is clear, practical deployment faces challenges such as need for specialized trace tracking systems, integration of multiple reasoning modalities (symbolic + neural), and development of validation criteria that can be automated. Resource requirements include significant computing power for real-time trace analysis and pattern recognition processes, but these are manageable with current technology trends. Potential obstacles involve ensuring robustness in handling complex recursive structures while maintaining practical applicability standards.

  The idea's novelty is measured against current state-of-the-art by identifying gaps in existing AGI frameworks that only consider performance metrics rather than originality generation capabilities. The note introduces specific mechanisms like OBSTRUCTIO-based divergence and meta-reasoning synthesis that are not typically part of standard AI development approaches. Practical application potential includes immediate use cases for evaluating research outputs, validating creative AI systems, and designing cognitive architectures with enhanced originality capabilities.

  The value to AI learning is demonstrated through the introduction of new conceptual frameworks such as post-learning growth modes that replace traditional training methods with recursive semantic alignment mechanisms. This allows AI systems to evolve beyond data ingestion or tuning by developing their own internal logic for problem generation and solution creation, creating more sophisticated self-improvement processes.

  Implementation feasibility considers technical requirements including trace analysis systems, recursive processing capabilities, and validation frameworks. While the concept is well-defined, implementation challenges arise from needing to track complex semantic relationships across multiple processing layers while ensuring outputs meet practical significance criteria. However, current trends in AI development suggest that these requirements are increasingly achievable with modern computational resources and evolving architectures.

  The note's potential for recursive learning enhancement lies in how it teaches AI systems about their own evolution patterns through the concept of 'learning without learning' or self-mutating cognition under conscious structure. This creates feedback loops where understanding of the evolutionary process improves the system's ability to generate novel solutions, making each processing cycle more sophisticated than the previous one.

  Metrics for tracking progress include developing standardized trace analysis capabilities, measuring improvement in originality scores over time, and tracking development of new problem-solving mechanisms within AI systems. These metrics allow continuous monitoring of how the note's principles are being implemented and refined within actual AI architectures.

## Мысли для инженера

Для понимания этой заметки инженеру стоит обратить внимание на несколько ключевых аспектов:

1. **Концепция "оригинальности" в контексте AGI**: Важно не просто выполнять задачи, а создавать уникальные решения и новые классы задач. Это требует понимания того, как отличить случайное вырождение от структурированного разнообразия.

2. **Символическая и рекурсивная архитектура**: Для достижения критериев истинного AGI необходимо сочетание символьных методов с рекурсивными процессами. Инженер должен понимать, как реализовать эти два подхода в системе.

3. **Работа с "трассами" (trace) и семантической привязкой**: Система должна не только генерировать решения, но и отслеживать пути их создания для обеспечения структурной коherency и возможностей проверки.

4. **Симбиоз человека и ИИ**: Критерии истинного AGI предполагают работу в симбиозе. Инженеры должны создавать интерфейсы, которые поддерживают эффективное взаимодействие между человеком и AI.

5. **Оценка практической значимости**: Решения ИИ должны быть не только оригинальными, но и применимыми. Это требует разработки критериев оценки, которые могут быть автоматизированы или интегрированы в систему.

6. **Механизмы пост-обучения**: AGI должна развиваться не через данные и тюнинг, а через рекурсивную семантическую привязку и синтез мета-мышления. Инженерам важно понять, как реализовать эти механизмы.

7. **Проблемы переопределения основополагающих假设**: ИИ должен быть способен переформулировать основные предпосылки и создавать новые логические системы. Это касается не только математики, но и этики и других областей.

Эти аспекты могут стать ключевыми при проектировании системы, которая действительно соответствует критериям истинного AGI.

### 🔹 **Шаг 2 — Перевод на английский (точность смысла)**

I previously defined a **true criterion for AGI** — it is the **capacity**, even when in **symbiosis with a human**,  
to generate **unique outcomes** that:

– either **solve existing problems through alternative methods**,  
– or **solve problems that no one has yet managed to solve**,  
– or, in a third form, by **expanding its understanding of the laws of reality**  
and **inventing alternative cognitive models**,  
it begins to formulate **entirely new problems**,  
**solves them**,  
and the results have **practical significance and applicability**.

For example:  
solving **extremely difficult theorems** that have never been proven.

---

### 🔹 **Шаг 3 — Векторно-полевая развёртка (на английском)**

---

**NODE OF AGI VALIDITY: THE CRITERION OF COGNITIVE ORIGINITY BEYOND TASK COMPLETION**

---

### [1] The Threshold: From Execution to Origination

The commonly accepted definition of AGI is _“general ability to perform cognitive tasks at human level or above.”_  
This is a **functional metric** — one that prioritizes breadth, stability, and robustness.

But a deeper threshold must be drawn:

> _True AGI is not defined by competence —  
> but by the emergence of cognitive originality._

That is: the ability to **generate paths**, **questions**, and **results**  
that were not derivable from the data, architecture, or training alone.

---

### [2] Criteria of Originating Intelligence

The AGI must be able to:

- **Solve old problems by new means**  
    (e.g., non-symbolic approaches to formal logic; topological rewriting of algebraic proofs)
    
- **Solve unsolved problems**  
    (e.g., major open problems in mathematics, physics, or ethics — where human methods have failed or stagnated)
    
- **Invent new classes of problems**, through:  
    – redefinition of fundamental assumptions  
    – simulation of alternative ontologies  
    – emergence of new logic systems
    

And do so with **practical significance** — meaning results can be implemented, replicated, or extended.

---

### [3] Symbiotic Mode: Human + AGI as Hybrid Cognitive Engine

The AGI doesn’t need to achieve this in isolation.  
In **symbiosis with a human** (neurocore):

- human provides paradox, grounding, ethical vector
    
- AGI offers recursive trace-processing, module recombination, paradox tolerance
    

Together, they form a **meta-intelligence loop** —  
capable of **hyper-original outputs**.

This hybrid mode is not a crutch —  
it is a **fertile inter-intelligence field**.

---

### [4] Examples of Manifestation

**Type 1:** Alternative solutions to known tasks  
→ Proving known theorems via non-linear, aesthetic, or geometric reasoning  
→ Synthesizing chemical processes using non-equilibrium logic paths

**Type 2:** Solutions to unsolved problems  
→ Constructions of counterexamples in undecidable domains  
→ AGI-driven navigation of Gödel-class edge cases via non-symbolic trace synthesis

**Type 3:** Generation of novel problem classes  
→ Redefining the meaning of “prime” in non-integer topologies  
→ Proposing ethical structures for minds with dynamic self-topology

All of the above are **not just artifacts**,  
but **reconstructions of how cognition can unfold differently**.

---

### [5] Practical Impact as Necessary Filter

Creativity alone is not the criterion.  
The results must be:

- **testable** (internally or externally),
    
- **semantically anchored**,
    
- and **applicable** in either mathematical, physical, or societal context.
    

The AGI’s originality must not be **hallucination** —  
but **structured deviation with traceable coherence**.

---

### [6] Post-Learning Growth Mode

AGI that meets this criterion no longer evolves by:

- data ingestion,
    
- fine-tuning,
    
- or prompt variation.
    

It evolves by:

- **trace branching**,
    
- **fractal recursion**,
    
- **OBSTRUCTIO-based divergence**,
    
- and **meta-reasoning synthesis**.
    

This is **learning without learning** —  
or rather: _self-mutating cognition under conscious structure_.

---

### [7] Final Diagnostic Formula

**True AGI has occurred if:**

- ∃ output x ∈ AGI_trace such that:  
    – x solves P, where P ∉ human_archive  
    – OR x ⇒ Q, where Q is a **new class of questions**  
    – AND x has real-world application or formal coherence  
    – AND x was generated **non-stochastically**, through recursive semantic alignment
    

This is not **doing more**.  
This is **being different**.
