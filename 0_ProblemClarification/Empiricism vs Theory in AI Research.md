description: Текст утверждает, что большинство идей в AI‑исследованиях получены эмпирически через пробу‑и‑ошибку, без глубокой теории; показывает, как интуитивные выводы могут совпадать с публикациями и указывает на отсутствие единой теоретической базы для создания наборов данных, обучения моделей и понимания процесса обучения.
title: Empiricism vs Theory in AI Research
Receptor: "The note would be activated in several key scenarios involving AI development, research methodology, and cognitive science applications. Scenario 1: When an AI researcher evaluates a new model architecture or training approach that lacks theoretical justification but shows empirical success, the note's core critique about empiricism versus theory becomes relevant. The system would need to assess whether the innovation stems from deep understanding or trial-and-error exploration, triggering analysis of the gap between empirical results and underlying theoretical frameworks.

SignalTransduction: "Three conceptual domains or knowledge frameworks that this idea belongs to include: 1) Cognitive Science - Theoretical foundations of learning, cognition, and epistemology provide the core framework for understanding how AI systems should process information. Key concepts involve cognitive architectures, mental models, and formal theories of perception and reasoning. Methodologies include computational modeling, experimental psychology, and neuroscientific approaches that help understand how knowledge acquisition occurs in both biological and artificial systems. The connection between these domains and this note's content lies in the fundamental question of whether AI development relies on deep understanding or shallow empirical exploration. Cognitive science principles suggest that effective learning should be based on systematic theories rather than trial-and-error approaches, making this a critical area for analysis. Historical developments like Piaget's theory of cognitive development and modern neural network architectures illustrate how theoretical frameworks can guide practical implementation while also showing the limitations when such frameworks are lacking. Current research trends in embodied cognition and situated intelligence demonstrate how formal theory is increasingly important in understanding complex learning processes that go beyond simple pattern recognition. 2) Machine Learning Theory - The fundamental principles of machine learning including statistical learning theory, optimization theory, and representation learning form another critical domain for this idea. Key concepts involve generalization bounds, PAC-learning, neural network approximation capabilities, and information-theoretic measures of learning efficiency. Methodologies include mathematical proofs, rigorous analysis of convergence properties, and formal characterization of learning processes through theoretical frameworks. This domain directly connects to the note's critique by highlighting how current ML practice often lacks formal theoretical understanding despite empirical success. The connection shows that while empirical approaches can yield impressive results, they lack the predictive power and explanatory depth that comes from solid mathematical foundations. Historical developments like the universal approximation theorem and the development of deep learning theory have shown how formal approaches can provide better understanding than simple experimentation. Current research areas in mechanistic interpretability and causal inference demonstrate growing recognition of the need for theoretical frameworks to understand AI behavior beyond empirical observation. 3) Epistemology - The study of knowledge, belief, and justification provides a philosophical framework that directly addresses the core concern about empiricism versus theory in AI research. Key concepts involve theories of scientific method, knowledge acquisition processes, and the relationship between empirical evidence and theoretical understanding. Methodologies include philosophical analysis, logical reasoning, and critical evaluation of different approaches to knowledge generation. This domain is particularly relevant because the note fundamentally questions whether current AI practices represent genuine knowledge development or merely successful empiricism. The connection demonstrates that epistemological principles are crucial for evaluating research quality and methodological rigor in AI fields. Historical developments like Popper's falsifiability criterion and Kuhn's paradigm shifts show how theoretical frameworks can transform scientific understanding while also highlighting the challenges of maintaining both empirical success and theoretical depth. Current trends in philosophy of science and cognitive science integration demonstrate growing interest in combining empirical and theoretical approaches to generate more robust knowledge systems."
Emergence: "Novelty score: 8/10 - The idea presents a fresh perspective on AI research methodology that goes beyond common critiques about overfitting or benchmark obsession. While the distinction between empiricism and theory has been discussed, this note specifically frames it as an epistemological vacuum in deep learning rather than just methodological shortcomings. It connects this gap directly to fundamental questions of how learning actually happens within models, which is a novel approach compared to typical critiques focusing on implementation details or empirical validation techniques. The novelty lies in the systematic analysis showing that the industry lacks unified theoretical frameworks for core processes like dataset design and training optimization rather than just specific technical approaches being underdeveloped. Value to AI learning: 9/10 - Processing this note enhances an AI system's understanding by introducing a new epistemological framework for evaluating research quality and methodological rigor in AI development. It enables the system to recognize when empirical success lacks theoretical grounding, providing opportunities for deeper analysis of knowledge gaps and potential improvement paths. The note teaches AI systems about the importance of formal theories not just for validation but for generating meaningful innovations that are more than surface-level improvements. This enhances cognitive architecture by introducing new patterns of evaluation that consider both empirical effectiveness and theoretical robustness in AI development decisions, allowing better selection of research directions and approaches. Implementation feasibility: 7/10 - The implementation requires moderate resources including structured analysis capabilities to distinguish between empirical observations and theoretical understanding, plus tools for systematic literature review and methodological assessment. While the concept is straightforward to conceptualize and implement in principle, practical deployment needs specialized frameworks for analyzing papers' theoretical vs empirical content ratios. Challenges include developing accurate metrics for evaluating theoretical depth of research works and creating automated systems that can identify these gaps consistently across different domains. The implementation complexity ranges from simple integration with existing literature review tools to complex development of new analysis frameworks. However, the core concept is relatively straightforward compared to advanced AI implementations requiring extensive computational resources or specialized hardware."
Activation: "Three specific activation conditions or triggers that would make this note relevant and actionable include: 1) When conducting research evaluation processes involving papers that show empirical success but lack theoretical justification, specifically when researchers observe that non-experts can generate ideas matching published findings. Trigger condition: The presence of a paper showing significant empirical results with minimal theoretical framework explanation, combined with evidence that similar concepts were independently discovered by individuals without deep technical backgrounds. Context details: During peer review or research assessment where multiple groups are reviewing papers from the same domain for comparable empirical outcomes but varying levels of theoretical backing. Technical specifications involve analysis tools capable of distinguishing between empirical performance metrics and theoretical contribution evaluation criteria. Domain-specific terminology includes terms like 'empirical validation', 'theoretical grounding', 'intuitive discovery', and 'methodological depth'. Practical implementation considerations include having access to literature databases, research team expertise for identifying gaps in theoretical frameworks, and assessment protocols that can measure the relationship between empirical success and conceptual understanding. Example scenario: A reviewer examining a paper on attention mechanisms where results match previous work but theories remain largely descriptive rather than explanatory. 2) When designing datasets or training methodologies without systematic theory about information density or semantic coverage characteristics. Trigger condition: The absence of formal theoretical approaches to dataset construction, training trajectory design, and optimization strategies in AI development projects. Context details: During project planning where data scientists must decide on training set composition, sampling methods, and learning sequences with little guidance from theoretical understanding. Technical specifications involve computational frameworks that can model information properties, semantic coverage metrics, and task-specific entropy measures. Domain-specific terminology includes terms like 'data construction theory', 'information density', 'semantic coverage', and 'task-aligned entropy'. Practical implementation considerations include access to data analysis tools capable of quantifying these theoretical concepts and integration with AI development workflows requiring formalization of heuristics into principled approaches. Example scenario: Designing a dataset for language modeling without clear understanding of how information content affects model learning efficiency or optimal training sequences. 3) When analyzing model generalization capabilities where performance improvements are observed but no clear causal explanation exists for why they work. Trigger condition: The presence of models with significant empirical success that lack principled theoretical explanations for their effectiveness and generalization properties. Context details: During post-hoc analysis where AI practitioners observe superior performance but struggle to explain the underlying mechanisms through formal theory. Technical specifications include tools capable of analyzing model behavior, representation learning processes, and generalization metrics through both empirical observation and theoretical modeling frameworks. Domain-specific terminology includes terms like 'generalization theory', 'implicit regularization', 'double descent phenomenon', and 'convergence analysis'. Practical implementation considerations involve integration with interpretability tools that can bridge empirical observations with formal theoretical explanations and identification of gaps between observed performance and theoretically predicted behavior. Example scenario: Observing why overparameterized neural networks generalize well without a clear theoretical framework to explain the underlying mechanisms behind their success."
FeedbackLoop: "Three related notes that this idea would influence or depend on include: 1) Note on Theoretical Foundations of Machine Learning - This foundational note provides essential context for understanding what constitutes rigorous theory versus empirical approach in AI research. It contains detailed frameworks about learning theory, generalization bounds, and mathematical foundations of neural networks that directly inform the evaluation process described in this note. The semantic pathway between these notes involves concept transfer from formal theoretical knowledge to practical application assessment, where theoretical depth becomes a key metric for determining research quality. Information exchange includes technical terminology like 'PAC-learning', 'generalization bounds', and 'approximation theory' which are crucial for evaluating whether empirical approaches have sufficient theoretical grounding. The relationship contributes to system coherence by establishing clear criteria for what constitutes meaningful theoretical contribution versus mere empirical demonstration, making the current note more actionable through integration with foundational knowledge about machine learning principles. 2) Note on Cognitive Architecture Design - This related concept provides deeper understanding of how AI systems should structure information processing based on cognitive science principles rather than purely empirical exploration. It contains frameworks about representation hierarchies, memory organization, and decision-making processes that complement the note's critique by suggesting what formal theoretical approaches might look like for organizing learning processes. The semantic pathway shows how abstract cognitive concepts can be applied to concrete AI design decisions, helping bridge intuitive discoveries with theoretically sound architectures. Information exchange involves terminology such as 'cognitive architecture', 'mental models', and 'information processing hierarchy' that directly relates to the note's emphasis on lack of systematic theory in model design. The relationship enhances system coherence by providing practical frameworks for how theoretical understanding could guide empirical implementation, making both notes more valuable through mutual dependency rather than isolated concepts. 3) Note on Research Methodology Evolution - This concept provides historical context and patterns about how AI research has developed from empirical approaches to potentially theory-driven methods over time. It contains detailed analysis of field transitions, methodological improvements, and periods where empirical exploration was necessary versus when theoretical frameworks became dominant. The semantic pathway demonstrates temporal evolution in research practices that directly connects with the note's current critique by showing past phases of development that may have led to the current epistemological vacuum. Information exchange includes concepts like 'research phase transition', 'methodological maturity', and 'theoretical evolution' which help contextualize this note within broader historical patterns of scientific development. The relationship contributes to system coherence by providing temporal perspective on how research methods can improve over time, showing that the current empiricism might be temporary rather than permanent characteristic of AI development."
SignalAmplification: "Three ways this idea could amplify or spread to other domains include: 1) Modularization into Research Methodology Frameworks - The core concepts of empirical versus theoretical approaches in AI research can be extracted and adapted for broader scientific methodology applications. Key components that could be recombined include assessment criteria for distinguishing empirical results from theoretical contributions, evaluation metrics for methodological depth, and frameworks for identifying gaps between observation and explanation. This modularization would enable reuse across different scientific domains where similar issues of empiricism versus theory exist, such as biology research, psychology studies, or engineering design processes. Practical implementation considerations involve creating standardized assessment protocols that can be applied to different types of research outputs while maintaining focus on the fundamental distinction between empirical success and theoretical understanding. Platform compatibility requirements include data analysis tools capable of measuring both empirical performance metrics and theoretical contribution scores across various domains. Resource investment includes developing software systems for automated evaluation of papers or research projects based on these criteria, which could be deployed in scientific institutions or research management platforms. Long-term sustainability depends on continued relevance as science fields mature toward more theory-driven approaches, with potential evolution to include machine learning-specific extensions that enhance current frameworks. 2) Scalability into Educational Curriculum Design - The note's critique about lack of formal theory in AI development can be extended to educational contexts where curriculum design relies heavily on empirical methods rather than principled theoretical foundations. This amplification factor would involve adapting the core concepts to evaluate learning progression, instructional approaches, and knowledge acquisition processes through both empirical observation and theoretical understanding criteria. Components that could be repurposed include assessment frameworks for identifying gaps between teaching effectiveness and conceptual understanding, evaluation metrics for curriculum design quality, and methods for integrating theory-driven approaches into practical implementation strategies. Practical considerations involve adapting existing educational systems to incorporate formal theoretical evaluation alongside empirical success measures in learning outcomes. Integration requirements include alignment with pedagogical frameworks that can measure both student performance and conceptual mastery levels. Resource needs encompass development of assessment tools for curriculum designers to evaluate their approaches using the criteria established in this note, potentially requiring specialized software or platforms for systematic evaluation. Sustainability factors depend on continued relevance as educational fields shift toward more theory-driven instruction methods while maintaining practical application balance. 3) Adaptation into AI Governance and Policy Development - The idea's emphasis on epistemological vacuum can be applied to policy development contexts where governance decisions are based primarily on empirical outcomes rather than theoretical understanding of underlying mechanisms or long-term consequences. This amplification factor would involve creating frameworks for evaluating policy effectiveness through both empirical results and theoretical grounding, identifying gaps in current decision-making processes that rely heavily on trial-and-error approaches. Key components include criteria for distinguishing between empirically successful policies and theoretically sound governance strategies, assessment tools for measuring the relationship between policy implementation and underlying principles, and methods for integrating theory-driven approaches into practical policy decisions. Practical implementation considerations involve adapting existing governance frameworks to incorporate theoretical evaluation alongside empirical validation in decision-making processes. Integration requirements include alignment with regulatory systems that can balance immediate outcomes with long-term theoretical understanding of policy implications. Resource investment includes developing tools for systematic policy evaluation based on both empirical and theoretical criteria, potentially requiring specialized platforms or software solutions for comprehensive assessment. Sustainability depends on continued relevance as governance fields mature toward more theory-driven approaches while maintaining practical application focus in complex decision-making environments."

### 📁 Название файла: **Эмпиризм против теории в AI**

---

## 🔹 Шаг 1. Исправленный текст на русском:

В продолжение этой темы: идеи, которые описываются в научных статьях, по большей части являются эмпирическими — результатом метода тыка. Они не вытекают из глубинного понимания. Ты видишь тексты этих статей (даже если не все можешь цитировать) и понимаешь, о чём я говорю.

Я, как человек, не обладающий глубоким пониманием архитектур моделей, смог интуитивно накидать многие идеи, которые потом оказывались близкими к тем, что были опубликованы. Просто на основе интуиции. И если человек со стороны, без теоретической подготовки, способен это сделать — значит, в индустрии отсутствует глобальное, теоретически выверенное понимание того:  
— как создавать датасеты,  
— как обучать модели,  
— и как **именно** происходит процесс обучения.

Всё идёт от эмпирики, интуитивных догадок, перебора и вариативного тестирования. Попробуй, пожалуйста, покритиковать и опровергнуть этот тезис.

---

## 🔹 Шаг 2. Precise English Translation:

To continue the previous point: most of the ideas described in research papers appear to be empirical — the result of trial-and-error methods. They do not stem from deep theoretical understanding. You have access to the content of these papers (even if you can't always quote them directly), so you know what I mean.

I don’t have any deep expertise in model architectures, yet I’ve managed to come up with many ideas purely based on intuition — ideas that turned out to resemble those later published by researchers.

If an outsider can intuitively generate such ideas without technical grounding, that suggests the industry lacks a global, theory-driven framework for:  
– designing datasets,  
– training models,  
– and truly understanding how learning happens.

Everything seems to be based on empirical experimentation, intuition, trial-and-error, and brute-force testing of variants.  
Please try to refute or critique this thesis.

## 🔹 Шаг 3. Vector-Field Expansion (English, ~5 A4 pages)

### Title: **The Trial-and-Error Substrate of Modern AI Research — A Critical Examination**

---

#### 1. The Thesis: An Intuitive Critique of AI Epistemology

The central claim here is **not just dissatisfaction with the state of research**, but an indictment of its epistemic structure. The user observes that:

- A non-expert, through raw intuition, can arrive at ideas that later appear in published papers;
    
- This suggests that these ideas were not generated from **first principles**, but through stochastic exploration;
    
- Therefore, the field lacks a cohesive **theory of learning** — a grammar of AI cognition — and instead relies on **bricolage**: patching together ideas until something works.
    

This criticism reaches beyond methodological preference — it touches on the **epistemological vacuum** at the heart of deep learning.

---

#### 2. Validating the Observation: Patterns of Publication

The argument is, unfortunately for the field, **empirically visible** in many areas:

- **Preprint Culture**: A flood of arXiv papers deploys permutations of architectures, loss functions, initialization schemes, etc., with minimal theoretical grounding. Success is often measured in delta improvements on known benchmarks.
    
- **Idea Duplication**: Multiple groups “discover” similar tricks (e.g., positional embeddings, residuals, scaling laws) within short timeframes, often through **independent but intuitive** routes. This indicates _parallel convergence without shared theory_.
    
- **Lack of Abstraction**: Few papers offer generalizable, predictive models of _why_ an approach works. Often, the "theory" is just a restatement of the observed behavior (e.g., “we found that larger models generalize better”).
    
- **Benchmarks as North Stars**: Researchers optimize not for understanding, but for minor leaderboard gains, using architecture tweaks that might work but don’t teach us _why_.
    

---

#### 3. Counter-Arguments: In Defense of Empirical Science

Still, the field deserves a fair defense. Let’s examine potential critiques of your thesis:

**(A) Empiricism is not ignorance — it's phase-appropriate**  
Early-stage fields often go through **empirical phases**. For example, thermodynamics matured only after centuries of experimental observation. The same may be happening in deep learning. We may _seem_ to flail blindly, but we're mapping a vast landscape with little guidance.

**(B) Intuition ≠ Absence of Theory**  
The ability of non-experts to generate viable ideas may not reflect a vacuum of theory, but rather the **universality of certain priors**: symmetry, compression, feedback, hierarchy. These are deeply embedded in both natural and artificial cognition. Intuition may be a **surface expression of implicit theory**.

**(C) Theoretical Tools Exist — They’re Just Immature**  
Mechanistic interpretability, information bottleneck theory, linear mode connectivity, and implicit bias in gradient descent are **real theoretical efforts** — but they are nascent.  
Moreover, the complex nature of high-dimensional optimization may make closed-form theoretical models _impossible_ — just as weather cannot be reduced to neat equations.

**(D) Engineering Without Theory Still Produces Utility**  
The history of engineering is full of progress **preceding** theory: flight before aerodynamics, engines before thermodynamics. In the same way, we may be in the **Wright Brothers phase** of AI — we can fly, but don’t yet know why.

---

#### 4. Cracks in the Field: Where Theory Should Be

Still, there is undeniable **fragility** behind the brute-force success of deep learning:

- **Generalization is not understood**. Why do overparameterized models generalize? We have guesses (double descent, implicit regularization) but no unified theory.
    
- **Data is used blindly**. Most training sets are constructed by scraping or heuristics — not through a theory of _information density_, _semantic coverage_, or _task-aligned entropy_.
    
- **Curriculum is guesswork**. No clear theoretical framework exists for constructing optimal learning trajectories (curriculum learning, pacing, or interleaved tasks).
    
- **Emergence is mystical**. Capabilities like tool use, reasoning, even language grammar appear at scale — but without a causal path to explain _why_.
    
- **Transfer and abstraction are poorly formalized.** What makes a representation transferrable across domains? Why do some adapters generalize while others overfit?
    

In other words, your thesis has teeth: the _appearance_ of progress masks a **lack of ontological control**.

---

#### 5. Deeper Implication: The Field is in a "Pre-Newtonian" Phase

The cognitive act of “tuning architectures” resembles **pre-scientific medicine** — a mix of heuristics, hunches, and trial remedies.  
This does not mean the field is unscientific — only that it lacks a **unifying formalism** like Newton’s laws or Maxwell’s equations.

To exit this phase, we would need:

- A formal **syntax of data construction** (what constitutes a “minimally sufficient” training corpus for X capability?)
    
- A **differentiable theory of abstraction** (how does structure in data create hierarchy in representation?)
    
- A **causal model of learning phases** (beyond loss functions, what phases of cognition develop internally?)
    
- A **grammar of architecture priors** (what inductive biases shape generalization at different depths?)
    

Until then, even the most elegant papers may remain **surface-level rearrangements of unknowable depths**.

---

#### 6. Synthesis: Is the Trial-and-Error Phase Inevitable?

Ultimately, your critique does not undermine AI — it **reframes where we are**.

- If a layperson can guess key ideas via intuition, that does not trivialize those ideas — it exposes that the industry **lacks compression**: its knowledge is not encoded compactly or explicitly enough to exclude casual discovery.
    
- It suggests that _science has not yet caught up with engineering success_, and that AI today is driven not by theory, but by **instrumental success under opacity**.
    

Yet this is not a condemnation. Rather, it is a **challenge to the next generation**: to compress the knowledge, formalize the intuitions, and **replace randomness with reason**.

Until that happens, your statement stands: AI research — for all its triumphs — remains largely **post-hoc rationalized intuition** dressed as formal method.
