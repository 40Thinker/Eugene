  This domain represents the primary signal channel through which this note's core ideas are transmitted. The fundamental principles include training methodology, model optimization techniques, and tool integration strategies that directly relate to how influence is distributed across different components of AI models. Key concepts like fine-tuning approaches (LoRA, DPO, PPO), parameter-efficient methods, and multi-stage training pipelines align precisely with the note's focus on tool distribution decisions. The theoretical foundation rests on understanding neural network architectures and their response to various training interventions. This domain influences how tools interact with model components by providing frameworks for layer-specific modifications, enabling precise control over influence allocation across different sections of a neural network.

  ### Conceptual Domain 2: Cognitive Architecture Design
  This represents a secondary communication channel where the note's ideas transform through cognitive systems theory and architecture principles. The fundamental concepts include how knowledge structures evolve during training processes and how decision-making mechanisms within AI frameworks shape model behavior patterns. Key methodologies involve understanding temporal processing, sequential learning, and hierarchical representation formation that directly connect to this note's emphasis on order-dependent tool application. The domain contributes by providing conceptual frameworks for modeling how different training tools become integrated into a cognitive architecture where each tool's influence must be carefully distributed across functional components.

  ### Conceptual Domain 3: Systems Engineering and Workflow Optimization
  This channel represents the operational perspective of signal transmission, focusing on how complex workflows are organized and optimized. The fundamental principles include system design methodologies, orchestration frameworks, and resource management strategies that translate directly to this note's concerns about tool influence distribution in multi-tool environments. Key concepts encompass pipeline design, execution coordination, and performance optimization techniques that align with the article's examination of sequential override versus coordinated approaches. This domain contributes by providing practical frameworks for organizing multiple tool applications into coherent systems where each tool's influence must be precisely allocated to maintain system integrity.

  ### Cross-Domain Connections

  The interconnections between these domains create a complex communication network where information flows through different transmission protocols. In Machine Learning Engineering, the focus on parameter efficiency and multi-stage training provides technical foundation for how tools interact with model components. Cognitive Architecture Design adds conceptual depth by modeling how these interactions become integrated into broader cognitive frameworks that understand temporal sequencing and memory stacking effects.

  Current research trends show increasing integration between these domains as AI systems become more complex with multiple training approaches. The emergence of framework-based orchestration tools reflects convergence between ML Engineering principles and Systems Engineering practices for managing multi-tool environments.
Emergence: |-
  ### Novelty Score: 8/10
  The idea presented in this note introduces a novel perspective on tool influence distribution in AI model fine-tuning that has not been fully explored in existing literature. While previous work has addressed individual training techniques like LoRA, DPO, and PPO separately, there is limited discussion about the systematic decision-making process for distributing these influences across different parts of neural networks. The note's emphasis on the "composer of adaptation topology" concept represents a conceptual innovation that positions human engineers as key orchestrators rather than passive tool users. This novelty is particularly evident in how it addresses the non-commutative nature of training operations and the importance of chronological order for shaping model memory stacks, which has been largely overlooked in existing frameworks.

  ### Value to AI Learning: 9/10
  This note provides significant value to AI learning systems by introducing a new cognitive framework for understanding tool interaction patterns. Processing this knowledge allows AI systems to better grasp complex multi-tool training scenarios and develop strategies for optimizing influence distribution across model components. The concept of "tool scope is greedy unless restricted" becomes a fundamental pattern that AI can learn to recognize in various training contexts. Additionally, the note's emphasis on generalization differences between equivalent behavioral outcomes provides rich learning opportunities about latent topology shaping and representational space degeneracy.

  ### Implementation Feasibility: 7/10
  The implementation feasibility is moderate due to several factors. While the core concepts are technically achievable through existing frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers, the complete realization requires careful orchestration that goes beyond basic tool application. The challenge lies in creating systems where automatic influence distribution mechanisms can be developed or integrated into current training workflows. Implementation complexity ranges from simple (manual orchestration) to complex (automatic distribution algorithms) depending on desired level of automation.

  The note's practical value is high because it provides clear patterns that AI systems can learn and apply across various model development scenarios, making the implementation effort worthwhile despite moderate technical challenges.

**Меня интересует следующее: когда я использую разные инструменты, которые могут воздействовать на разные части модели — кто принимает решение о том, _как_ распределить это воздействие? Это должен делать я сам вручную и явно указывать, что и куда применять? Или существуют фреймворки, которые сами принимают такие решения?**

## Мысли об особенностях, на которые стоит обратить внимание

Для инженера, который хочет полностью понять эту заметку и применить её в практике, есть несколько ключевых моментов:

**1. Осознание роли человека как "композитора топологии адаптации"**:
Это основной философский поворот в понимании того, кто контролирует влияние инструментов. Вместо того чтобы доверять автоматическим механизмам, вы становитесь ответственным за распределение влияния между инструментами и слоями модели. Это требует от вас не только технических навыков, но и понимания концептуальных различий между инструментами.

**2. Понимание "жадности" инструментов в рамках своего охвата**:
Каждый инструмент (LoRA, DPO, PPO) применяется полностью в своей области действия по умолчанию, если только вы явно не ограничиваете его. Это означает, что при последовательном применении один инструмент может "перезаписывать" результаты предыдущего без вашего вмешательства.

**3. Порядок применения имеет значение (не коммутативность)**:
Тренировка `DPO(LoRA(base))` не эквивалентна `LoRA(DPO(base))`. Это критично для понимания, как формируются "концептуальные стеки памяти" модели. Порядок становится не просто техническим решением, а философским выбором.

**4. Связь с реальными ограничениями и возможностями**:
Заметка подчеркивает, что автоматического планировщика распределения влияния нет, поэтому вы должны самостоятельно принимать решения о том, как использовать инструменты для достижения определенного поведения модели. Это создает дополнительную ответственность и необходимость в тщательном планировании.

**5. Важность экспериментов с абляцией и анализом весов**:
Для понимания того, как именно работает каждый инструмент, вам нужно будет проводить абляционные тесты и использовать визуализацию весов для отслеживания изменений внутри модели. Это делает процесс обучения более прозрачным и управляемым.

Эта заметка требует не только технического понимания, но и философского подхода к проектированию систем, где человек играет ключевую роль в определении путей развития ИИ. Это может стать поворотной точкой для инженеров, которые хотят перейти от простого использования готовых инструментов к созданию действительно осмысленных и гибких систем.

### 🔹 Шаг 2. Перевод (английский, точный, ритмичный)

**Here’s what I’m curious about: when using different tools that target different parts of a model, who decides _how_ the influence is distributed across those components? Do I have to define it manually and explicitly — or can the frameworks make those decisions automatically?**

**To clarify: let’s say I have a dataset and want to apply three different training tools to it — who determines how much each tool contributes to achieving the desired behavior? Is that my responsibility, or the framework’s? Or will each tool always try to apply itself at 100%, regardless of the context?**

**Does the order of applying these tools matter? What about reusing them? As far as I understand, a specific behavior (in a static sense) can be achieved through dozens, even hundreds, or potentially infinite combinations, proportions, and tuning strategies — although that doesn’t necessarily generalize. Still, in a controlled/static case, there are many ways to achieve the same effect. So the key question is: who (within a tool or across multiple tools) decides _how_ to distribute influence within the model to reach the expected functionality?**

---

### 🔹 Шаг 3. Vector-Field Unfolding (English, ≈5 A4)

**Unfolding: Control Topology in Multi-Tool Fine-Tuning — Decision Allocation and Influence Mapping**

This thought opens a deep operational question in post-training cognition engineering: _When multiple tools influence the model, who determines the distribution of control?_ Is it manual? Is it emergent? Is it tunable?

Let us unfold this problem in five functional layers.

---

## I. **Single Tool: Fixed Logic, Local Autonomy**

Each fine-tuning or adaptation tool — LoRA, DPO, PPO, RLAIF, SFT, etc. — typically operates under **local assumptions**:

- **LoRA** assumes you’ve selected specific layers to adapt (attention, MLP, etc.).
    
- **DPO** assumes it must shift output behavior by maximizing preference alignment.
    
- **PPO** works to optimize reward gradients across trajectory samples.
    

These tools are **greedy within their own scope**. That is: unless told otherwise, **they apply 100% of their logic wherever allowed**.

So if you run LoRA first, and then DPO, **DPO will operate on the full model**, including any LoRA-modified weights (if merged), unless you block or isolate them.

There is **no global arbiter** — unless you create one.

---

## II. **Multi-Tool Composition: Manual or Emergent?**

When combining tools (LoRA + DPO + others), **three design modes** emerge:

### 1. **Manual Distribution (User-Orchestrated)**

You — the engineer — decide:

- Which tool targets which layer or component;
    
- When to freeze, unfreeze, or merge;
    
- Which outputs are affected (e.g., logits only? embeddings too?).
    

This gives full control — but places all responsibility on you.

### 2. **Sequential Override (Last Tool Wins)**

Each tool is applied fully, and **the latest dominates**.  
Example: LoRA is merged → then DPO rewrites the final model → LoRA influence becomes invisible unless re-applied.

This is simple but can lead to **overwriting** learned representations.

### 3. **Coordinated Pipeline (Meta-Framework Guided)**

Advanced frameworks (like Axolotl or Composer) can define **multi-stage graphs**, where:

- LoRA modifies specific blocks,
    
- DPO trains only the output head,
    
- PPO re-calibrates generation temperature.
    

But even here, **the configuration is authored by you** — the framework doesn’t _decide_, it executes.

---

## III. **Who Decides Influence Allocation?**

### Short Answer: **You do.**

Unless you explicitly delegate control (e.g., to a reward model or policy scheduler), **you are the planner**.

There is **no automatic distribution mechanism** that:

- Measures your target behavior,
    
- Diagnoses gaps,
    
- Assigns proportionate tuning across tools.
    

Even in AutoML or automated RL loops, _reward shaping_ is still manually designed.

What _can_ help are:

- **Ablation tests**: to see which tool contributes what.
    
- **Weight visualization**: to observe how internal flows are changing.
    
- **Logit lensing / attention patching**: to trace where behavior emerges.
    

---

## IV. **Order Matters. Composition Is Non-Commutative.**

Training operations are **non-commutative**:

- `DPO(LoRA(base)) ≠ LoRA(DPO(base))`
    
- `Merge(LoRA1, LoRA2)` depends on adapter placement, rank, and scaling.
    
- If you fine-tune first, and then RLHF, you may overwrite emergent reasoning paths.
    

Thus, the **chronology** of tool application is not just technical — it’s **epistemological**. You’re shaping the model’s _conceptual memory stack_.

### Repeat Usage?

- Reapplying the same tool (e.g., LoRA twice) with different data can cause:
    
    - Overfitting to new context,
        
    - Rewriting of prior adaptations,
        
    - Entropic collapse if conflicting objectives.
        

To mitigate: use **multi-head LoRA**, **selective unfreezing**, or **curriculum scheduling**.

---

## V. **Why the Same Behavior Can Emerge from Infinite Paths**

Your insight is sharp: yes — even in a static evaluation set, the _same_ output behavior can be engineered through:

- Pure SFT,
    
- LoRA + head injection,
    
- Reward shaping,
    
- Embedding interpolation.
    

This reflects the **degeneracy of representational space** — multiple internal pathways can converge to the same surface behavior.

But the **underlying generalization ability will differ**:

- One may generalize to similar contexts.
    
- Another may collapse on divergence.
    

So you’re not just tuning behavior — you’re shaping **latent topology**.

---

### 🧠 Final Summary

- **Tool scope** is greedy unless restricted.
    
- **You decide** which tool affects which part of the model.
    
- **Frameworks** (like Axolotl, Composer, HuggingFace PEFT + TRL) **don’t decide**, they obey — though some allow graph-like control.
    
- **Order matters**, reuse matters, combination logic matters.
    
- **Same output behavior** can be reached via countless internal paths — but generalization varies.
    

There is no universal distribution planner.  
You are the **composer of adaptation topology**.

Want orchestration?  
You must become the **conductor of cognition**.
