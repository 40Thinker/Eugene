🟦 **Шаг 3. Vector-Field Interpretation (English, Part 2):**

> **Meritocracy Reinstated: Structural Efficiency in AI via Core Contributor Recognition**
> 
> The user proposes a high-impact thesis: the decline in software quality and engineering robustness in AI companies stems not from model limitations, but from **human capital misallocation** — a dilution of technical depth through inflated, misaligned hiring practices.
