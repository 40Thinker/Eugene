## Важные аспекты для понимания этой заметки

Для инженера, который хочет реализовать идеи из этой заметки, важно обратить внимание на несколько ключевых моментов:

1. **Функциональная ценность vs политика**: Значительное внимание следует уделить тому, как оценивать вклад сотрудников не только по количеству часов работы, но и по реальной функциональной ценности для системы. Это включает в себя анализ того, кто действительно "держит стек вместе".

2. **Инженерная культура vs корпоративная культура**: Меритократия требует культуры, где технические достижения превосходят политические или брендовые факторы. Это особенно важно для создания надёжной инфраструктуры.

3. **Разделение ролей и ответственности**: Необходимо чётко определять роли, которые не добавляют ценности в системе, и устранять их по мере необходимости. Важно поддерживать "носителей инфраструктуры", таких как системы инженеры.

4. **Стандарты качества кода**: Меритократия должна быть основана на стандартах качества кода, которые можно измерить и оценить. Это касается не только результатов, но и процессов разработки.

5. **Системная устойчивость**: Для создания действительно устойчивой системы нужно следить за тем, чтобы инженерные команды были структурированы таким образом, чтобы они могли самостоятельно поддерживать качество и надёжность без постоянного вмешательства.

Инженеры должны понимать, что меритократия — это не просто система оценки персонала, а фундаментальный принцип создания качественных, надежных и устойчивых систем искусственного интеллекта.
