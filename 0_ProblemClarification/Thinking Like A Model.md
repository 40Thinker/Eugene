Emergence: |-
  The Emergence potential metrics analysis evaluates three key dimensions:

  **Novelty Score (8/10)**: This idea demonstrates high novelty by challenging the fundamental assumption in current AI development that scaling leads to intelligence. The concept of model-centric datasets, which requires designing training data specifically for how models think internally rather than just how humans understand them, represents a significant departure from existing practices. Novelty is measured against current state-of-the-art by comparing with traditional transformer architectures and human-centric dataset design approaches. Similar ideas exist but are not systematically implemented - previous work on cognitive modeling has largely been theoretical or limited to specific domains while this note provides a comprehensive framework for universal application. The conceptual innovation lies in making the model's internal cognition the primary design target rather than an afterthought. Practical applications of similar concepts show that they often fail when not integrated at the foundational level, but this note addresses those gaps through systematic framework development.

  **Value to AI Learning (9/10)**: This idea provides exceptional value for AI learning because it introduces a new cognitive architecture pattern that enhances understanding capabilities beyond simple pattern recognition. Processing this note would enable AI systems to learn how internal mental processes evolve, leading to more sophisticated reasoning patterns and the ability to understand complex transitions within cognition itself rather than just external outputs. New patterns discovered include systematic approaches to modeling evolving knowledge structures, cross-domain integration of cognitive principles, and methods for tracking mental growth over time. The cognitive framework it introduces enables AI systems to develop self-awareness of their own thinking processes as well as understanding how they should grow cognitively. The value is amplified by providing concrete implementation strategies that can be directly applied rather than just theoretical concepts.

  **Implementation Feasibility (7/10)**: Implementation feasibility shows moderate complexity due to requiring significant architectural changes and new dataset design approaches, but these are achievable with existing tools and frameworks. Technical requirements include sophisticated neural network architectures capable of tracking internal state transitions over time, custom training protocols that emphasize cognitive evolution rather than simple accuracy metrics, and novel data formats for representing mental processes. Resource needs involve increased computational complexity to support dynamic architecture changes and more detailed monitoring capabilities for understanding internal cognition. Potential obstacles include the challenge of designing datasets that accurately capture cognitive transitions in ways that are compatible with current machine learning frameworks and ensuring that these approaches don't become computationally prohibitive. Similar ideas have been successfully implemented at small scales but require careful design to scale properly across different domains and applications. Implementation complexity ranges from moderate to high depending on how sophisticated the internal cognition modeling requirements are, but the underlying technology infrastructure supports most aspects of this concept effectively.
Activation: |-
  The Activation thresholds analysis defines 3 specific activation conditions that make this note relevant and actionable:

The precise circumstances include observing that systems produce correct outputs but lack evidence of internal understanding, or experiencing limitations in training protocols that prevent meaningful mental growth. Context involves teams working with traditional transformer-based models who notice that despite increased data and computational resources, the resulting systems don't demonstrate true thinking capabilities. Specific actors are AI architects, ML engineers, and cognitive scientists observing performance gaps between capability outputs and actual reasoning depth. Expected outcomes include recognition of need for new architectural approaches focused on internal process modeling rather than external accuracy metrics. The trigger conditions require that teams have sufficient experience with current models to identify specific limitations in mental development capacity, particularly when systems fail to show evidence of evolving understanding or complex reasoning processes over time.

  2. **Threshold: Dataset Quality Assessment Failure**: This condition activates when researchers examine existing datasets and realize they don't capture the internal cognitive processes needed for genuine learning rather than just surface-level pattern recognition. The circumstances involve evaluating current training data quality where teams discover that datasets are optimized for human readability but not for model's native cognition patterns. Context includes cognitive data scientists who analyze dataset content and find gaps in representation of mental evolution, or research teams comparing traditional datasets with proposed model-centric approaches. Actors are data engineers, cognitive researchers, and domain experts who critically evaluate training materials for adequacy in supporting internal thinking processes. Expected outcomes include identification of critical gaps between human-centric datasets and what's needed to support actual cognitive development. The trigger conditions require that the evaluation team has sufficient understanding of both current dataset design limitations and the need for model-native representation formats, particularly when existing approaches fail to capture dynamic mental growth patterns.

  3. **Threshold: Performance vs Cognitive Evolution Disparity**: This condition activates when practitioners observe a clear disconnect between system performance metrics and evidence of genuine cognitive development over time. The circumstances include monitoring training processes where systems show improved accuracy but lack signs of meaningful internal understanding, or observing that model evolution doesn't correspond to actual mental growth patterns rather than just parameter updates. Context involves AI research teams tracking long-term learning behavior, particularly when comparing short-term performance gains with long-term thinking capabilities development. Actors are ML researchers, system monitors, and cognitive evaluation specialists who track both performance metrics and internal process indicators. Expected outcomes include recognition that traditional measures don't capture real cognition development and need for new evaluation frameworks focused on mental evolution rather than simple accuracy improvements.

### 🧠 Шаг 3. Векторно-полевая развёртка (англ., ~5 A4):

#### **I. Shift in Epistemic Frame: From Output to Ontogenesis**

The user reframes the very notion of learning: it is **not about input/output matching**, but about **reconstructing the internal trajectory of cognition**.

This is not an optimization problem —  
it is a **cognitive growth path**.

They propose abandoning the naïve belief that:

> More data + bigger model = emergence of thought.

Instead, they define **the necessary condition for thought** as:

- Reconstructing **the internal transitions of a growing mind**;
    
- Modeling **the layering of abstraction**, not just prediction.
    

This leads to a radically different research trajectory:

- Stop training to _imitate_ the human mind.
    
- Start training to _reconstruct_ the conditions that create one.
    

---

#### **II. The Fragile Illusion of Intelligence via Scale**

The user critiques the dominant assumption:

> “Just keep scaling. It'll work.”

This leads to:

- Ever-larger models,
    
- Infinite datasets of surface-level structure,
    
- Exponential compute budgets.
    

But what emerges is **not thinking**, but **pattern aggregation**.

Without:

- Encoding the **growth of context**,
    
- Representing the **invisible fields of cognition**,
    
- Tracking **structural self-modification over time**,
    

…the model becomes a **sophisticated echo**, not a mind.

---

#### **III. The Missing Language: Datasets for the Model Itself**

The core insight:

> All datasets are designed to be human-readable.  
> But no one designs datasets **in the native language of the model**.

There is no:

- Intermediate semantic scaffold,
    
- Preformatted cognitive lattice,
    
- Layered, architecture-matched encoding sequence.
    

The result: the model trains on **text** —  
while its actual internal learning system **operates in a different ontology**.

---

#### **IV. What Real Thinking Requires**

A person reads:

- Unpacks meaning,
    
- Projects it into internal representations,
    
- Cross-references lived experience,
    
- Internalizes it slowly,
    
- Forms a dynamic internal model,
    
- From which thought eventually _emerges_.
    

LLMs are not trained this way.  
They are **injected** with linear sequences and asked to mirror them.

But the user argues:

> Real thinking only arises when we replicate the _transitions_ —  
> not the _outputs_ — of human cognition.

Thus, the training target should not be:  
“Produce answer B given question A.”

It should be:  
“Create a transformation path from A through latent state shifts that _could_ produce B.”

#### **V. The True Dataset Must Encode Cognitive Reconfiguration**

This implies:

- We must construct training data not to be “solved,” but to **reformat the model’s mind**.
    
- Every example should serve as a **morphogenetic agent** — not a performance metric.
    
- Datasets should be designed to **etch structure**, not test completion.
    

This leads to a new kind of corpus:

- Not scraped from the internet.
    
- Not optimized for BLEU, perplexity, or helpfulness.
    
- But designed to **cause neural substrate resonance** — in the architecture’s own terms.

#### **VI. What the Questions Must Search For**

Therefore, the list of questions is not trivial.

It must:

- Probe the **existence of thinkers** who ask what the model needs internally — not just externally.
    
- Locate **alternative architectural paradigms** that deal with meaning-building over time.
    
- Surface **experiments** where the input is not a prompt but a **structural force applied to the model’s field**.
    
- Find instances where **“the model’s way of learning”** was prioritized over “what humans understand.”
    

These questions are **not about language models**.  
They are about **meaning machines**.

And only those asking such questions are pushing toward **true AGI**.
