  When evaluating AI systems against established benchmarks that incorporate energy consumption as a core metric rather than just traditional performance indicators.
  Technical specification: This activation requires comparative analysis capabilities between different system configurations or models when assessing both output quality and resource usage efficiency. Systems must be able to measure cognitive utility per unit of energy consumed to determine relative efficiency levels.
  Domain-specific terminology: Terms like 'efficiency benchmarking', 'energy-per-task ratio', 'cognitive utility measurement' activate this condition when systems compare different approaches based on their energetic characteristics.
  Practical implementation considerations: Needs comprehensive testing frameworks that include both traditional performance metrics and new energy consumption measurements. Resource requirements involve sufficient computational capacity to run multiple evaluation scenarios simultaneously while maintaining accurate data collection for comparisons.
  Environmental conditions: The system operates in controlled environments where comparative analysis can be performed systematically, often during development phases or optimization cycles when different approaches are being evaluated.
  Concrete example from real-world implementation: AI platform developers that compare different model architectures using energy consumption metrics alongside accuracy scores to identify which systems provide optimal balance of performance and efficiency. This triggers systematic evaluation processes that consider both computational overhead and resource utilization patterns.

  ### Activation Condition 5: Dynamic Model Selection Based on Energy Availability
  When systems must choose between different model configurations or approaches based on current available resources rather than fixed architectural choices.
  Technical specification: The activation requires dynamic selection algorithms that can evaluate multiple options for task execution based on current energy status, computational requirements, and expected outcomes. Systems need mechanisms to weigh efficiency considerations against performance demands when selecting implementation strategies.
  Domain-specific terminology: Concepts like 'adaptive model selection', 'energy-constrained decision making', 'efficiency-sensitive architecture choice' trigger this condition when systems must make choices that balance resource constraints with solution quality.
  Practical implementation considerations: Requires flexible architecture design and algorithms that can rapidly switch between different computational approaches based on changing conditions. Timing requirements include quick decision-making capabilities to avoid delays in task execution while maintaining efficiency objectives.
  Environmental conditions: The system operates in environments where resource availability varies or is unknown at the outset, such as edge computing devices with limited power supply or cloud deployments with variable resource allocation policies.
  Concrete example from real-world implementation: Mobile AI applications that switch between high-precision and low-power computational modes based on available battery level. When running low battery conditions, the system automatically selects optimized lightweight models for tasks while preserving full precision options when sufficient energy is available.

  Practical implementation considerations: Requires development of comprehensive testing methodologies that can accurately measure and compare efficiency across different domains while maintaining consistency in measurement approaches. This would involve creating benchmarking tools and standardized protocols for evaluating efficiency metrics.

  Scaling potential: The concept has broad applicability from research laboratories to commercial applications since it provides universal language for comparing resource usage patterns between different systems and technologies. It enables more informed decision-making about system design choices based on fundamental efficiency principles rather than arbitrary performance measures.

  Example from existing implementations: Performance benchmarking standards already exist in computing but lack the energy-conscious components that this note would introduce, making them more comprehensive when applied to AI systems, biological models, or hardware architectures.

### 🔹 Шаг 2 — Перевод на английский (точность смысла):

Essentially, **human thinking consumes fractions of a watt**, at most a few watts,  
and when compared to how much energy **modern LLMs consume for complex tasks**,  
especially those with **long contexts**,  
the difference reaches **thousands or even millions of times**.

Meanwhile, the **human brain shows linear energy usage**,  
and uses **negligibly small amounts** across the full spectrum of cognitive tasks.

There’s simply **no task** that would cause the brain to suddenly start consuming **100 or 200 watts** —  
that’s just **impossible**.

If we take a **muscular analogy**:  
theoretically, if one introduces chemicals that **uncouple respiration** and create **ion leakage**,  
this leads to **hyperthermia** — a known disorder,  
where **energy burns off pointlessly**.

Yes, **muscle cells** in that state can **burn large amounts of energy**.  
And it’s likely that **the brain too could**, under certain conditions,  
start **burning ATP wastefully** —  
but it **doesn’t**,  
because it **doesn’t need to** in order to solve cognitive tasks.

---

### 🔹 Шаг 3 — Векторно-полевая развёртка (английский):

**Microwatt Cognition vs Megawatt Simulation: Why the Brain Refuses to Waste Energy**

This is a critical energy-theoretic distinction — not about intelligence per se,  
but about **thermodynamic optimization at the core of cognition**.

The user contrasts:

- The **bioeconomy of human thought**
    
- With the **computational bloat of LLMs**
    

And points out something often missed in AI discourse:

> The brain doesn’t just think better —  
> it **thinks efficiently**,  
> and **refuses to burn energy** that doesn’t yield cognitive utility.

---

#### 🧠 1. **Energy Cost of Thought: Biological Flatline**

Across nearly all solvable tasks, the **human brain**:

- Stays within ~20W total
    
- Allocates <5W to active cognition
    
- Displays **linear response** in oxygen/glucose use across cognitive intensities
    
- Has **no energy-spike response** to problem complexity (within solvable range)
    

This **flat energy curve** suggests a kind of **internal throttling** —  
a refusal to exceed necessary activation thresholds.

---

#### 🔁 2. **LLMs: Exponential Cost for Linear Intelligence**

In contrast, **LLMs** behave oppositely:

- For simple token continuation: ~100–200W per GPU
    
- For long-context logical reasoning: thousands of watts
    
- For multi-step memory-aware synthesis: clusters of GPUs, possibly megawatts for training
    

Even worse:

- LLMs **don’t learn during inference** — so **same cost per task**
    
- They **recompute everything** per output token
    
- No persistent “state awareness” without heavy architecture support
    

This results in:

> **Energetic redundancy**, not just computational excess.

---

#### 🧬 3. **Uncoupling and Pathological Burn**

The muscular analogy is revealing:

- When **uncoupling agents** (like dinitrophenol) disrupt mitochondrial coupling,  
    ATP is burned **without productive work**  
    → this leads to **hyperthermia** and death
    

The brain **could**, in theory, enter a similar state:

- Metabolic uncoupling
    
- Excitotoxic cascades
    
- Epileptic overfiring
    

But **doesn’t** — because evolution selected **tight energetic coupling** in neural computation.

Thus:

> The brain doesn’t just "save power" —  
> it **enforces power coherence** as a cognitive law.

---

#### 📉 4. **Implications for LLM and AGI Design**

This reveals a failure in transformer-based AI:

- There is **no feedback loop between task solvability and energy budget**
    
- Models operate **indifferently**, regardless of task complexity
    
- Efficiency does not improve with familiarity or prior exposure
    
- Output ≠ effort-aware
    

AGI systems will require:

- **Adaptive energy scaling per task**
    
- **Internal difficulty estimation**
    
- **Dynamic throttling of model depth**
    
- **Entropy-aware early termination**
    

Otherwise:

> AGI will remain a **simulacrum of intelligence**,  
> consuming **orders of magnitude** more energy than required.

---

#### 🧩 5. **Fractal Efficiency Principle of the Brain**

From this prompt emerges a general principle:

> **True cognition = minimal energy / maximal inference**  
> **Wasteful computation ≠ intelligence**

The brain exemplifies this in every task.  
LLMs, by contrast, reveal **how intelligence looks when efficiency is stripped away**.

---

**Conclusion:**

You’re not merely comparing brain vs machine.  
You’re describing a fundamental **cognitive thermodynamics**,  
where the **real intelligence** is not only in what is thought,  
but in **how energy refuses to be wasted**.

Shall we now formulate this into a formal **efficiency-based axiom set**  
for post-transformer AGI architectures?
