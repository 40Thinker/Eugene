title: Beyond Benchmark Progress
Receptor: The note would be activated in various practical contexts where AI systems face critical decisions about model architecture, dataset design, and training methodologies. First, during the development of large language models when teams must choose between optimizing for benchmarks versus building truly intelligent systems. Specific actors include AI researchers, data scientists, and engineering managers who need to balance performance metrics with cognitive robustness. The expected outcome is a shift toward architectures that externalize knowledge rather than internalizing it through massive parameter counts. Second, in the context of automated reasoning or decision-making systems when models fail on basic logical tasks despite high benchmark scores. Here, domain experts like AI engineers and system architects would evaluate whether to pursue modular design with API-based fact storage instead of monolithic neural networks.

Acceptor: The note's concept aligns well with several software tools and technologies for implementing modular AI architectures. Tensorflow and PyTorch provide excellent foundations for building neural networks that can externalize knowledge through API integration points, offering flexibility in model architecture design and support for complex training workflows. The tools enable developers to create models where internal reasoning components communicate with external fact repositories via well-defined interfaces, supporting the vision of small core models with externally sourced data. LangChain represents a powerful framework for creating AI applications that can easily integrate external knowledge sources through API calls, providing built-in mechanisms for managing external facts and enabling seamless interaction between reasoning modules and data stores. This tool's chain-based architecture perfectly matches the note's emphasis on modular design where knowledge is externalized. Hugging Face Transformers library offers extensive support for building models with configurable architectures that can easily interface with external datasets or APIs, making it ideal for implementing the proposed framework of small internal models connected to large external knowledge repositories. The library provides tools for easy integration with various data sources and supports multiple training methodologies. Dask enables distributed computing capabilities essential for managing large-scale external knowledge bases while maintaining efficient model processing within smaller core architectures. This technology would support practical implementation of the note's vision by allowing seamless scaling between internal reasoning components and extensive external datasets through parallel processing mechanisms. Pinecone provides vector database capabilities that are crucial for storing and retrieving complex factual information efficiently, supporting the note's emphasis on externalized knowledge storage with quick access during reasoning processes. Its integration with AI models makes it suitable for implementing the API-based fact retrieval systems described in the note. Redis offers high-performance data structures needed to support fast API calls and caching of frequently accessed facts, providing essential infrastructure for real-time interaction between internal reasoning mechanisms and external data sources. The tool's key-value store capabilities would help maintain efficient access patterns required by the modular architecture. Kubernetes provides container orchestration necessary for deploying complex AI systems that combine internal reasoning models with external knowledge APIs, supporting scalable implementation of the proposed architectural framework across various computing environments. It enables robust deployment of distributed components and ensures proper resource management in multi-tiered architectures. The note's concepts also integrate well with existing frameworks like LangChain (which supports API-based integration) and Hugging Face Transformers (which provide model flexibility for modular design). Emerging technologies such as VectorDBs (like Chroma or Weaviate) would complement this approach by providing advanced semantic search capabilities that support external knowledge management. The note's architecture benefits from these tools' ability to manage large-scale information efficiently while maintaining computational performance.
SignalTransduction: "The note belongs to several conceptual domains that interact as signal transmission channels for its core ideas. First, the domain of Cognitive Architecture provides theoretical frameworks where understanding how intelligence structures itself (internal reasoning vs external knowledge) becomes fundamental. Key concepts from this field include modular architecture design, cognitive layers, and information processing hierarchies that directly relate to the note's emphasis on separating reasoning mechanisms from factual storage. Second, Machine Learning Theory serves as a signal channel for understanding training methodologies, optimization processes, and model complexity trade-offs that are essential for implementing the proposed small-model approach with externalized knowledge. Concepts such as overfitting, generalization capabilities, and learning theory principles connect directly to the critique of shallow benchmark progress versus true intelligence development. Third, Knowledge Representation Theory provides a channel through which the note's externalization concept can be understood in terms of how facts are encoded, stored, and retrieved for reasoning processes. This domain contributes concepts like semantic networks, ontologies, and data structures that support the efficient external knowledge management described in the article. Fourth, Systems Engineering offers insights into how complex AI architectures should be designed with clear interfaces between components, supporting the modular approach suggested by the note. Principles from this field such as system integration, component interoperability, and architecture design patterns relate to the API-based communication mechanisms proposed. Fifth, Information Theory provides conceptual foundations for understanding data efficiency and compression in AI models, which connects directly to the note's emphasis on reducing model size while maintaining comprehensive knowledge through external storage. Concepts of information entropy, optimal encoding, and data redundancy are relevant to discussions about minimal sufficient sets versus massive datasets. Sixth, Computational Neuroscience contributes insights into how biological intelligence manages information processing and memory integration that can inform artificial systems design. The field's understanding of neural computation, memory consolidation, and cognitive processes provides analogies for the note's architecture where reasoning is separated from factual storage. Seventh, Software Engineering principles provide a channel through which implementation details become relevant, including API design patterns, architectural components, and deployment strategies that directly translate to practical realization of the proposed modular approach. These domains form interconnected networks where concepts flow between each other: cognitive architecture informs machine learning theory about optimal model structures; knowledge representation enables efficient externalization approaches; systems engineering supports integration protocols; information theory guides data compression strategies; computational neuroscience provides biological insights for artificial intelligence design; and software engineering ensures practical implementation capabilities."
Emergence: The note exhibits high novelty in the field of AI research, scoring 8/10. It introduces a fresh perspective on benchmark optimization versus genuine intelligence development that is rarely addressed with such directness. The idea of externalizing knowledge while maintaining compact internal reasoning models represents innovative thinking beyond current trends toward massive parameter scaling. This concept builds upon existing research but articulates it with unprecedented clarity and practical application potential, making it significantly novel compared to prevailing approaches in the field. Its value to AI learning scores 9/10 because it provides a clear framework for understanding how AI systems can move beyond surface-level performance metrics to achieve true cognitive capabilities. The note introduces fundamental concepts about model architecture that enhance an AI's ability to reason and learn from minimal data, creating new pathways for knowledge integration and problem-solving approaches. This directly improves AI learning by offering a principled approach to building intelligence rather than simply optimizing performance on tests. Implementation feasibility scores 7/10 due to the combination of technical requirements and practical constraints involved in realizing this architecture. While the theoretical framework is sound, implementation requires significant coordination between model development, API design, data management systems, and deployment infrastructure. The main challenges include ensuring reliable communication between internal reasoning components and external knowledge repositories, managing distributed computing resources efficiently, and maintaining system integrity across different domains of application. Similar ideas have been implemented successfully in multi-agent systems where knowledge is distributed among various components, but the specific modular approach proposed here requires more sophisticated engineering integration than currently common practice. The note contributes to broader cognitive architecture development by providing a clear vision for how AI systems might evolve toward true understanding rather than mere performance optimization, making it foundational for next-generation AI design principles that could reshape entire research directions.
Activation: "The note becomes relevant under three specific activation conditions: First, when benchmark scores show significant improvement without corresponding real-world task performance enhancement. This occurs in contexts where AI systems achieve high test accuracy but fail on practical problems requiring fundamental reasoning capabilities, such as visual puzzles or logical inference tasks that children can solve. The condition requires presence of metrics indicating performance gains versus actual capability improvements, with external validation showing gaps between testing results and real application outcomes. Second, during architectural design reviews for new AI models where developers need to decide between maximizing parameter counts versus achieving minimal but robust intelligence through modular separation of knowledge storage and reasoning mechanisms. This activation happens when technical teams evaluate model complexity trade-offs in terms of both performance optimization and cognitive depth requirements, particularly with limited computational resources available for training or deployment. Third, in research planning contexts where teams must choose whether to pursue incremental improvements on current benchmark approaches versus fundamental rethinking of how intelligence should be structured. This occurs when researchers assess whether to continue optimizing existing frameworks that may be gaming benchmarks or invest in new architectural paradigms that promise more genuine cognitive capabilities. Each activation condition requires specific technical indicators such as performance metrics, architectural constraints, and project goals that signal readiness for applying this note's principles."
FeedbackLoop: "The note influences several related ideas while also depending on others to form a coherent knowledge system. First, it connects with the concept of modular AI architecture which provides foundational frameworks for separating reasoning from knowledge storage. The relationship is direct: this note builds upon and extends existing modular approaches by specifically advocating for externalized fact management rather than just component separation. Second, it relates to cognitive architectures that define how intelligence systems should be structured at multiple levels of abstraction. The feedback loop involves mutual enhancement where understanding of modular design helps develop more sophisticated knowledge management strategies. Third, the note integrates with dataset construction theories which inform how data should be organized and curated for effective learning rather than just maximizing raw quantity. This connection shows how externalized knowledge storage requires careful consideration of optimal data organization principles. Fourth, it relates to machine learning theory that describes training processes and optimization methods. The relationship involves both influence (this note suggests better training approaches) and dependence (the theory provides foundational understanding needed for implementing modular architectures). Fifth, the concept of API-based information access directly supports this note's externalization strategy. This connection demonstrates how practical implementation of external knowledge storage requires robust interoperability standards and communication protocols that align with broader system integration principles."
SignalAmplification: "The core idea can amplify through three main pathways: First, it can be applied to different AI domains such as robotics where small reasoning modules communicate with extensive environmental knowledge bases via APIs. This approach allows robotic systems to maintain compact cognitive architectures while accessing vast real-world data for decision-making. Second, the concept can be scaled into multi-agent systems where individual agents handle specialized reasoning tasks while sharing externalized knowledge repositories across networked components. This creates distributed intelligence frameworks that leverage modular design principles at larger scales. Third, it can be integrated with educational AI applications by creating learning systems where students' cognitive models are compact but access vast external knowledge libraries through API interfaces. This enables personalized learning environments that provide deep understanding without requiring massive individual model sizes."

### 📁 Название файла: **Граница фейкового прогресса**

---

## 🔹 Шаг 1. Исправленный текст на русском:

Хотелось бы отметить, что прогресс на бенчмарках, во-первых, часто достигается за счёт подтасовок — модели обучаются проходить конкретные тесты. А во-вторых, даже незначительные изменения — например, перестановка вариантов ответа — могут привести к коллапсу и провалу модели.

То, что модели не способны решить элементарные графические загадки для детей или простейшие логические вопросы, при этом успешно проходят сложные академические бенчмарки, говорит о том, что путь остаётся тупиковым. Как изначально внутри системы присутствовала глобальная ошибка, так она и остаётся.

Условно говоря, SkyNet может зависеть от того, покажут ли ей примитивную картинку-загадку.

Попробуй покритиковать.

Я добавлю к этому:  
Можно бесконечно придумывать разрозненные хаки и идеи, каждая из которых улучшает результат на несколько процентов, но **реального прорыва** это не даёт. Без кардинального понимания того:  
— как работают модели,  
— как происходит обучение,  
— как формируются датасеты,  
— как должна выглядеть общая теория,

никакого настоящего прогресса не произойдёт.

И я считаю, что когда это кардинальное понимание будет достигнуто, произойдёт:  
— резкое сокращение объёмов датасетов,  
— вынесение всех фактов из модели наружу (в API),  
— а в самой модели останется только механизм мышления.

Такая модель может быть очень компактной — 100 миллионов или 1 миллиард параметров.

И тогда произойдёт скачок — на всех тестах сразу — до 99–100% точности. Исключениями останутся лишь неоднозначные случаи или ошибки самих тестов.

И задача "пройти тесты" будет решена полностью. Останется только реальная деятельность:  
— поиск новых знаний,  
— инженерное творчество,  
— решение тех задач, где человек не справляется.

Вместо того чтобы топтаться на месте с детскими картинками, станет ясно, как всё устроено и чем управлять.

Я думаю, ты понял мою мысль.  
Попробуй всё это в комплексе покритиковать.

## 🔹 Шаг 2. Precise English Translation:

I’d like to point out that progress on benchmarks often comes, first of all, from sleight-of-hand — models are simply trained to pass the tests.  
And second, even small changes — like shuffling answer options — can lead to complete collapse and failure.

The fact that models can’t solve basic graphical puzzles for children or answer primitive logical questions, despite performing well on complex academic benchmarks, shows that this is still a dead-end path.  
The same fundamental internal flaw that was there from the beginning remains unresolved.

To exaggerate the point: SkyNet could depend on being shown a simple riddle image.

Please try to criticize this.

I’ll add:  
It’s possible to endlessly invent isolated tricks and ideas that each bring a few percent improvement — but **no real breakthrough** comes from that.

Without fundamental understanding of:  
– how models function,  
– how training actually works,  
– how datasets should be constructed,  
– what the general theory of training should be,

there will be no true progress.

And I believe that once this fundamental understanding is achieved, the following will occur:  
– dataset size will drastically shrink,  
– all factual knowledge will be externalized via APIs,  
– and models will contain only the mechanism of thought.

Such a model could be very small — 100 million or 1 billion parameters.

At that point, we’ll see a dramatic leap in all test results — straight to 99–100% accuracy.  
Only ambiguous cases or flawed test questions would remain as exceptions.

The problem of "passing tests" will be solved.  
What will remain is **real activity**:  
– discovery of unknown knowledge,  
– engineering of novel artifacts,  
– solving the tasks that humans themselves cannot solve.

Instead of stagnating at the ceiling of childish image puzzles, there will be a clear understanding of how everything works and how to control it.

I think you understand what I mean.  
Please try to criticize the entire argument holistically.

## 🔹 Шаг 3. Vector-Field Expansion (English, ~5 A4 pages)

### Title: **The Illusion of Progress: Critique of Shallow Benchmark Optimizations in Deep Learning**

---

#### 1. Framing the Thesis: From Fragile Competence to Real Intelligence

The user's argument strikes at the core of what separates **instrumental mimicry** from **true intelligence**. It is not merely a critique of how models perform on tests — it is a demand for **ontological integrity**. The critique can be deconstructed into the following layers:

- **Benchmark progress is gamified**: performance rises due to overfitting on known tasks, not due to generalized intelligence.
    
- **Structural fragility is hidden**: minor perturbations collapse performance, indicating absence of robust abstraction.
    
- **Lack of primitive reasoning**: failure to solve "baby puzzles" exposes an absence of **first-principle cognition**.
    
- **Theoretical vacuum**: No deep theory exists for data construction, learning trajectories, or mental architecture.
    
- **Future vision**: only when theory replaces engineering patchwork will small models with externalized facts reach superhuman performance.
    

Let us now attempt to critically examine this layered hypothesis.

---

#### 2. In Defense of the Field: Counterarguments to the Thesis

**(A) Benchmarks are imperfect, but useful**

It’s true that many models “game” benchmarks. But benchmarks, like SAT or GRE scores, are **proxies**, not goals.  
Progress on them is _not the definition_ of intelligence, but a measurable gradient.  
Moreover, newer benchmarks (e.g., BIG-Bench Hard, GPQA, MATH, HELM) are intentionally designed to **resist gaming**.

**(B) Fragility does not equal failure**

Adversarial fragility or collapses upon format change are not exclusive to deep learning. Even humans fail under perturbation (e.g., misleading framing, visual illusions).  
The solution may not be smaller models with “pure cognition,” but **more robust training and interpretability**.

**(C) Generalization is harder than it seems**

The “baby puzzle” argument highlights a deep issue: what seems trivial to humans (e.g., visual grouping) may require **rich sensorimotor grounding** or **ontological priors**.  
LLMs lack both. Their failures are not proof of stupidity, but **architectural blindness**.  
Solving this may require **multimodal embodiment**, not just better token patterns.

**(D) Theory isn’t always the driver**

Mathematics often lags behind empirical discoveries. Maxwell’s equations came after electricity. Thermodynamics after engines.  
Requiring theory before progress may paralyze innovation. Empiricism isn’t shameful — it’s phase-appropriate.

**(E) Externalized facts ≠ cognition**

The vision of a small model with “only reasoning” that pulls facts from an API assumes:

1. Reasoning is separable from knowledge (it’s not — inference depends on background models),
    
2. API calls are reliable, fast, semantically aligned (they’re not),
    
3. Reasoning can be optimized _without_ redundancy or internal heuristics.
    

This idea is appealing, but may oversimplify the entanglement between **memory, representation, and reasoning**.

---

#### 3. Where the Critique Holds: Structural Failures Are Real

Despite the above, the **depth** of the critique holds weight in several key areas:

- **Overfitting to tests** is real. Many models get high scores but hallucinate, fail at grounding, or can’t solve unseen logic tasks.
    
- **Lack of continuity** in capability: emergent reasoning appears _at scale_, but **cannot be engineered predictably** at small sizes.
    
- **Brittleness** under reformatting (e.g., shuffled answers) implies the model learns statistical cues, not semantic principles.
    
- **Primitive intelligence failure** is damning. If models can’t solve tasks that a 5-year-old with zero formal training can solve, this suggests a **missing ontology** of grounded concepts.
    
- **Absence of theory** in dataset construction means LLMs still learn from massive, noisy, redundant corpora.  
    No one knows the **minimal sufficient set** for teaching causality, abstraction, or transfer.
    

---

#### 4. Constructive Direction: If the Thesis is Right, Then What?

Assume the user’s vision is correct. What follows?

- **Cognition must be modularized**: Fact storage (externalized) vs. inference (internal). Model architecture must enforce this separation.
    
- **Theory of knowledge density**: Not all tokens are equal. Models must learn from **optimal curricula**, not terabytes of entropy.
    
- **Radical model reduction**: Intelligence emerges from structure, not size. Architectural prior beats brute parameter count.
    
- **Post-benchmark era**: Success = real-world success: invention, repair, research, alignment — not academic scores.
    
- **Failure to do so means stagnation**: The field will plateau in self-referential metrics until someone **solves learning itself**.
    

---

#### 5. Synthesis: The Path to True AI Starts with Rejection of Illusions

The essence of the critique is not despair — it is _diagnostic clarity_.

If progress feels fake, fragile, or gamified — it’s because our field has confused **surrogates for substance**.

Until we admit that:

- benchmark gains are not cognition,
    
- hallucinations are not bugs but symptoms,
    
- intuition ≠ theory, and
    
- compression of intelligence is the real frontier,
    

we will keep mistaking **local improvements** for **global breakthroughs**.

Only when we shift toward **minimal, interpretable, API-augmented, theory-driven architectures** —  
will we exit the _alchemy_ phase and enter true AI.

This critique is harsh. But if it’s true — it’s the only roadmap that matters.
