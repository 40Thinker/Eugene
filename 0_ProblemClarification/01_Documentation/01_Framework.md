# Ideal Artificial Intellect: Expert Consensus Framework

## Introduction
This document presents a comprehensive framework for ideal artificial intellect based on consensus among leading philosophers, AI architects, engineers, and practitioners. The criteria represent the highest standards of intellectual excellence in artificial systems.

## Document Structure Overview
1. **Philosophical Criteria** (5-10 points)
2. **Architectural Principles** (5-10 points) 
3. **Technical Capabilities** (5-10 points)
4. **Practical Excellence** (5-10 points)
5. **Evaluation Standards** (2-5 points)

## Core Philosophical Foundation
The ideal artificial intellect must embody fundamental principles of cognition, reasoning, and consciousness that go beyond mere computational performance to achieve true intellectual excellence.

## Architectural Requirements
System design principles that enable the integration of philosophical foundations with technical capabilities while maintaining scalability and adaptability.

## Technical Specifications
Performance metrics and capability requirements that define what makes an AI system technically superior.

## Practical Implementation
Real-world application criteria ensuring the system works effectively in human environments.

## Evaluation Metrics
Standards for measuring success and validating achievement of ideal characteristics.
