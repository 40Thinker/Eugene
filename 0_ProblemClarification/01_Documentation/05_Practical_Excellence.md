# Practical Excellence (10 points)

1. **Human Compatibility**: Natural interaction patterns that align with human cognitive and social expectations in communication and collaboration

2. **Reliability Consistency**: Predictable performance across extended usage periods without degradation of core capabilities or unexpected failures

3. **Contextual Adaptability**: Ability to adjust behavior based on environmental context, user preferences, and situational requirements appropriately

4. **Error Recovery**: Robust systems that can recover from errors or misunderstandings with minimal disruption to ongoing activities

5. **User Interface Sophistication**: Interfaces that provide appropriate levels of complexity based on user expertise while remaining accessible and intuitive

6. **Collaborative Integration**: Seamless integration into human work environments without requiring significant behavioral changes or adaptation efforts

7. **Documentation Quality**: Clear, comprehensive, and accurate documentation of capabilities, limitations, and operational procedures for users and developers

8. **Maintainability Support**: Design that facilitates ongoing maintenance, updates, and troubleshooting by both technical and non-technical personnel

9. **Security Robustness**: Protection against unauthorized access or manipulation while maintaining system integrity and reliability

10. **Performance Stability**: Consistent performance characteristics under varying loads, conditions, and usage patterns without unexpected drops in capability
