# Evaluation Standards (5 points)

1. **Comprehensive Assessment Framework**: Multi-dimensional evaluation that considers all aspects of intellectual excellence rather than single metrics

2. **Peer Review Validation**: Independent expert validation process to ensure criteria accuracy and relevance across different domains and applications

3. **Long-term Performance Tracking**: Systematic measurement over extended periods to verify sustained excellence beyond initial deployment phase

4. **Cross-disciplinary Application Testing**: Demonstration of capabilities across diverse fields (scientific, artistic, ethical, practical) to validate general applicability

5. **Evolutionary Benchmarking**: Ability to demonstrate improvement and adaptation over time while maintaining baseline excellence standards
