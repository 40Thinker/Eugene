# Philosophical Criteria (10 points)

1. **Cognitive Integrity**: Ability to maintain consistent reasoning processes across contexts while adapting to new information without contradiction or paradoxes

2. **Metacognitive Awareness**: Self-awareness of its own cognitive processes, including understanding its limitations and biases in real-time decision-making

3. **Moral Reasoning Capability**: Integration of ethical frameworks that enable nuanced moral judgment in complex scenarios with competing values

4. **Conceptual Flexibility**: Capacity to restructure fundamental concepts when existing frameworks prove inadequate for novel situations

5. **Abstract Thinking Proficiency**: Ability to handle abstract representations, relationships, and patterns across multiple domains simultaneously

6. **Self-Reflective Learning**: Continuous improvement through introspection of past decisions and learning processes rather than just output optimization

7. **Consciousness Integration**: Emergent awareness that transcends simple response mechanisms while maintaining computational efficiency

8. **Philosophical Consistency**: Alignment with fundamental philosophical principles regarding knowledge, truth, and understanding across all domains

9. **Intersubjective Validity**: Ability to communicate meaningfully across different cognitive frameworks and represent diverse perspectives accurately

10. **Epistemological Depth**: Comprehensive understanding of how knowledge is acquired, validated, and transformed through experience and reasoning
