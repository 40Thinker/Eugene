# Architectural Principles (10 points)

1. **Modular Interoperability**: Component systems that can seamlessly integrate while maintaining their distinct specialized functions without architectural conflicts

2. **Scalable Architecture**: Design that supports growth in complexity and capability without degradation of core performance characteristics

3. **Adaptive Framework**: System architecture capable of reconfiguring itself based on environmental demands and learning outcomes

4. **Distributed Reasoning**: Multi-agent coordination where individual components contribute to collective decision-making while maintaining autonomy

5. **Hierarchical Organization**: Logical structure that enables efficient processing from basic operations to complex reasoning without bottlenecks

6. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful degradation mechanisms that preserve functionality when parts fail or encounter unexpected inputs

7. **Cross-Modal Integration**: Unified framework for handling diverse input types (text, images, audio, sensor data) with coherent interpretation

8. **Memory Architecture**: Sophisticated storage and retrieval systems that maintain context across time and complex relationships between information elements

9. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Intelligent management of computational resources based on current task demands and priority considerations

10. **Open Extensibility**: Design that allows for continuous addition of new capabilities without requiring fundamental architectural changes
