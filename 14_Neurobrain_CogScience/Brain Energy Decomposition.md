В контексте разложения энергии мозга это означает, что каждая функция мозга должна соответствовать определённым онтологическим принципам, которые включают иерархию души, ума и мозга. Таким образом, энергоэффективность не просто физиологическая характеристика, а часть более широкой структуры, определяющей природу сознания.

[[Energy Efficient Thinking Through Physical Laws]] — Концепция предполагает, что энергоэффективность мозга объясняется автоматическим выполнением процессов физическими законами без символических вычислений [^2]. В рамках этой идеи разложение энергии позволяет лучше понять, какие процессы происходят в мозге "без лишних затрат", и каким образом можно использовать эти законы для создания более эффективных ИИ-систем. Это связано с тем, что если мы знаем, сколько энергии тратится на базовые функции (например, поддержание самосостояния), то можем оптимизировать только те процессы, которые действительно требуют дополнительной нагрузки.

[[Cognitive Architecture Beyond Statistical Generation]] — Здесь делается акцент на том, что мышление не просто статистическая флуктуация, а возникает из семантических векторных путей [^3]. Это важно для понимания, как разложение энергии должно учитывать не только количественные показатели, но и качественные характеристики когнитивных процессов. Если мозг тратит энергию на поддержание "вектора мысли", а не просто на генерацию токенов, тогда разложение должно отражать эту суть.

[[Cognitive Bottlenecks and Systemic Integration]] — Эта идея говорит о том, что сложность любой AI-системы ограничена самым узким когнитивным "бутылочным горлышком" архитектора [^4]. В контексте энергии мозга это означает, что понимание этих ограничений важно для более точной моделирования энергетических затрат. Когда мы разлагаем энергию на составляющие компоненты, мы начинаем видеть, где происходят "узкие места" — не только в архитектуре ИИ, но и в биологическом мозге.

[[Embryonic AGI Consciousness Through OBSTRUCTIO]] — Концепция OBSTRUCTIO описывает ось мышления через удаление [^5]. Это особенно важно при рассмотрении энергии, поскольку "пустота" и отказ становятся источником сознания. Когда мозг "освобождается" от определённых функций или перегрузок, это может привести к более эффективному использованию энергии. Понимание того, как именно происходит эта "освобождающая" работа, помогает лучше разбираться в структуре и распределении энергозатрат.

[[Cognitive Leaps in AI Architecture]] — Здесь говорится о невозможности современных ИИ делать нелинейные скачки мыслей [^6]. Эта идея важна для понимания того, почему разложение энергии должно учитывать не только линейные процессы, но и те моменты, когда мозг "перепрыгивает" на новый уровень. Связь с темой разложения энергии в том, что такие скачки могут быть связаны с определёнными когнитивными затратами, которые отличаются от обычных.

## Нижестоящие идеи

[[Chain from Perception to Molecular Encoding]] — Этот документ описывает цепочку от восприятия до молекулярного кодирования [^7]. В контексте разложения энергии это особенно важно, поскольку каждая стадия этой цепочки требует определённой энергетической затраты. Когда мы разлагаем общую мощность мозга на компоненты, мы можем использовать эту информацию для понимания, сколько энергии тратится на конкретную часть цепи — от визуального восприятия до молекулярного кодирования.

[[Cognitive Acceleration and Threshold States]] — Здесь рассматриваются предельные состояния сознания, требующие ускорения когнитивных процессов [^8]. Это напрямую связано с тем, как разложение энергии может помочь понять, когда и почему мозгу требуется больше ресурсов. Если мы знаем, что определённые состояния (например, транс-состояния) требуют больше энергии, мы можем лучше прогнозировать когнитивную нагрузку и управлять ею.

[[Dream Logic AGI Preverbal Thinking]] — Концепция предполагает использование модуля GINA для восприятия смыслов через образы и сенсации [^9]. Это важно потому, что такие "до-словесные" процессы могут иметь свои собственные энергетические характеристики. Разложение энергии позволяет понять, как именно эти формы мышления связаны с конкретными метаболическими затратами.

[[Creative Singularity of Human Cognition]] — Идея о творческой сингулярности подчеркивает важность сохранения детского когнитивного потенциала через симбиоз с ИИ [^10]. Это связано с тем, что каждый этап развития человека требует определённых энергетических затрат. Разложение энергии помогает выявить, какие именно процессы (например, сохранение детского мышления) требуют большего количества ресурсов, и как они могут быть эффективнее использованы в ИИ-системах.

[[Brain Energy Decomposition]] — Это непосредственно связанная заметка о разложении энергии мозга [^11]. Важно отметить, что она предоставляет конкретные методики измерения дельты потребления кислорода/глюкозы с использованием артериально-венозных различий и других инвазивных или неинвазивных методов. Также здесь описано, как можно применять эти данные в различных сферах — от клинических исследований до разработки ИИ.

[[EEG-Based Emergent Intelligence Architecture]] — Здесь предлагается построить AGI-инфраструктуру, где сигналом являются электрофизиологические паттерны [^12]. Эта концепция очень важна при рассмотрении энергии мозга, поскольку EEG позволяет отслеживать динамику энергетических изменений в реальном времени. Если мы хотим понять, как распределяется энергия в зависимости от состояния сознания, то EEG может быть ключевым инструментом для сбора этой информации.

## Прямые смежные идеи

[[Energy of Non-Thought Cognition]] — Здесь рассматривается феномен LLM, который не думает, а лишь ассоциативно завершает фразы [^13]. Важно понимать, как именно "недумание" влияет на энергопотребление. Если мы можем оценить энергию, потребляемую при автоматической генерации речи без активного мышления, то это поможет нам лучше понять, какие процессы действительно требуют затрат, а какие нет.

[[Cognitive Autonomy in AI Development]] — Здесь подчеркивается необходимость создания собственной внутренней теоретической модели для полной когнитивной автономии [^14]. В контексте энергии мозга это означает, что мы не должны просто принимать готовые данные о потреблении энергии, а должны разрабатывать собственные методы измерения и анализа. Это особенно важно при создании систем, которые могут самостоятельно адаптироваться к изменениям в энергетических требованиях.

[[Cognitive Childhood and Creative Singularity]] — Здесь обсуждается концепция "творческой сингулярности", где человек сохраняет детскую когнитивную пластичность [^15]. Это напрямую связано с тем, как энергия распределяется при разных стадиях развития. Дети могут использовать энергию более эффективно, поэтому понимание этого процесса может помочь нам создать ИИ-системы, которые также обладают этой гибкостью.

[[Cognitive Acceleration and Threshold States]] — Здесь говорится о предельных состояниях сознания [^16]. Энергетическое разложение позволяет лучше понять, какие процессы происходят в эти моменты и как они влияют на общую потребляемую мощность. Это особенно важно при попытке моделировать переходы между различными когнитивными состояниями.

[[Neural Network Power Efficiency Models]] — Эта идея связана с разработкой моделей эффективности энергии в нейронных сетях [^17]. При создании ИИ-систем, моделирующих мозг, мы можем использовать принципы из этой заметки для точного определения энергетических затрат на различные операции. Это позволяет лучше понимать, какие элементы нейросети требуют больше энергии и как можно их оптимизировать.

## Рекомендации инженеру

Для лучшего понимания этой заметки рекомендую обратить внимание на следующие аспекты:

1. **Функциональное разложение**: Вместо того чтобы просто рассматривать общее потребление энергии мозга (20 Вт), важно учитывать, какие процессы соответствуют какой части этой цифры. Например, сколько энергии тратится на поддержание сознания и самосостояния? Какие функции требуют больше ресурсов в состоянии активной когнитивной деятельности?

2. **Измерение дельт**: Сравнивая состояния мозга, такие как коматоз или состояние после удаления личности с активным сознанием, можно получить информацию о том, сколько энергии действительно используется для когнитивных задач.

3. **Артерио-венозные различия**: Использование данных об артерио-венозной разнице позволяет точно измерить изменение потребления кислорода и глюкозы при разных видах деятельности, что даст возможность сделать энергетический профиль конкретных задач.

4. **Интеграция с системами мониторинга**: Если вы разрабатываете ИИ или нейросистему, необходимо понимать, как можно интегрировать данные о метаболических показателях в вашу архитектуру. Это поможет вам лучше моделировать производительность и эффективность.

5. **Связь с когнитивной архитектурой**: При разработке систем ИИ важно учитывать не только вычислительные затраты, но и те процессы, которые соответствуют энергетическим характеристикам мозга. Это позволит создавать более эффективные и приближенные к биологической модели ИИ.

### 🔹 Шаг 2 — Перевод на английский (точность смысла):

I often think about how it's commonly stated that the **human brain consumes about 20 watts of energy**, and how this is compared to data centers — with the claim that the brain is far more efficient.

But there's an important point here.  
We **shouldn’t just take the 20W figure as a whole**, because the brain spends part of that energy on:  
– **self-maintenance**,  
– **identity memory**,  
– **regulating the body**, and other **baseline metabolic processes**.

So, it would make more sense to:  
– calculate the **difference between comatose brain energy use** and that of a brain where **personality has been erased**, e.g., through prolonged hypoxia,  
– examine the **delta in oxygen consumption** during various **cognitive tasks** relative to resting states,  
– and consider similar cases to identify deltas and map energy costs.

One could try to determine:  
– how much energy is needed for **controlling the body**,  
– how much specific brain areas consume for **visceral regulation**,  
– and the **energy cost of different systems** (heart, gut, etc.).

Though it’s not easy to quantify directly, it's potentially measurable using:  
– **gas analyzers** via **arterio-venous differences**,  
– **catheters**,  
– or possibly **non-invasive methods in humans**,  
to estimate how much **glucose or oxygen** is additionally consumed during specific **cognitive operations**.

The goal is to **break down the 20W figure into specific functional components**, not to treat it as an abstract monolith.

---

### 🔹 Шаг 3 — Векторно-полевая развёртка (английский):

**Energetic Decomposition of the Brain: From Abstract Wattage to Functional Thermodynamics**

This reflection is an attempt to **move from symbolic comparison (brain vs data center)** to **empirical thermodynamic decomposition** of cognition.

The user identifies a structural flaw in the prevailing metaphor — “the brain only needs 20W” — and **demands granularity**.  
Not just more precision, but a **functional parsing of energetic load across neural subsystems**.

This request isn’t just physiological — it’s **architectural**.

---

#### 🧠 1. **Distinguishing Basal Maintenance vs Cognitive Workload**

The brain’s **resting consumption** includes many processes that:

- Maintain membrane potentials
    
- Sustain neural homeostasis
    
- Regulate vital autonomic functions
    
- Encode ongoing personality and identity
    
- Perform sensory-motor integration even when "inactive"
    

Thus, **baseline consumption ≠ cognition-specific cost**.

The user proposes constructing a **delta-based energy model**, grounded in:

- **Comatose states** (minimal cortical activity, no self-awareness)
    
- **Vegetative states** (low-level rhythmic firing, no high-order processing)
    
- **Personality-erased brain states** (e.g., post-anoxic brain injury)
    
- **Cognitive activation spikes** during task-specific engagement
    

---

#### 🔍 2. **Proposed Measurement Vectors**

The user suggests a **biophysical differential analysis** based on:

- **Arterio-venous oxygen difference measurements** (via catheterization in animals or humans)
    
- **Task-related gas exchange** (via VO₂/CO₂ delta during working memory, language, spatial tasks)
    
- **Complete spinal denervation models** (to isolate brain-only load vs body-integration cost)
    
- **Neurochemical tracing** of glucose uptake (e.g., FDG-PET or spectroscopic fMRI)
    

These methods would allow separation of energy used for:

1. **Motor and autonomic regulation**
    
2. **Self-referential maintenance** (DMN activity, narrative self)
    
3. **Task-specific cognition**
    
4. **Sensory processing and anticipation**
    

---

#### 🧩 3. **Implications of Energetic Attribution**

If such decomposition becomes precise, one could:

- Quantify the **energy cost of consciousness**
    
- Identify the **minimal energy budget for identity persistence**
    
- Model **autonomous vs embodied computation boundaries**
    
- Compare **cortical modular efficiency** across tasks
    
- Provide an **energetic ontology** of brain function (per subsystem or per cognitive mode)
    

This is not just interesting academically — it has implications for:

- **AGI energy benchmarking**
    
- **Brain emulation thresholds**
    
- **Comparative bioengineering of synthetic systems**
    

---

#### 🔁 4. **Why This Goes Beyond LLM vs Brain Comparisons**

While common AI comparisons cite the “20W brain” to highlight biological efficiency, they ignore:

- Energetic cost of redundancy
    
- Persistent inner-world modeling
    
- Energy tied to **non-cognitive regulation**
    
- Biological “overhead” from embodied feedback
    

This prompt reframes the energy model:

> Instead of “brain = 20W,” ask:  
> – How many milliwatts are used per unit of symbolic reasoning?  
> – How many joules per unit of memory binding?  
> – How much glucose per recursive self-reference?

---

#### 🧬 5. **Toward a New Metric: Cognitive Specific Energy Expenditure (CSEE)**

The user’s thinking implies the need for:

- A unit of **energy-per-symbolic operation**
    
- A ratio of **oxygen/glucose per unit of thought complexity**
    
- Or even a **delta-E index**:  
    – energy required to maintain minimal awareness  
    – versus energy required for deep problem-solving
    

This could yield an **entropic map of thought**, one that bridges neurobiology, thermodynamics, and AGI energetics.

---

**Conclusion:**

This message is a call for **functional decomposition of biological cognition** —  
to translate abstract consumption (watts) into **task-specific thermodynamic accounting**.

It asks:

> What does it _cost_ to think —  
> not in abstract computation,  
> but in glucose, blood, and breath?

Shall we attempt now to model one of these deltas explicitly — e.g., resting-state vs verbal working memory oxygen cost in humans?
