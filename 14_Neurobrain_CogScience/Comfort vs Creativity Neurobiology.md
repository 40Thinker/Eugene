### 🔹 Шаг 2 — Перевод на английский (точность смысла):

I’d like to bring in a few related analogies.

There’s a saying: **“The artist or creator must be hungry.”**

And in my own life, I’ve noticed that **the more ideal the conditions** —  
whether **physical** or **physiological** —  
the more likely the brain tends to **laziness**:  
it wants to **sleep**, **eat**, **have sex**, **seek pleasure**, **chase dopamine**,  
but **not engage in difficult creative work**.

On the other hand, when **conditions are non-ideal**,  
the brain may become **hyperactivated**.  
Not necessarily **to escape the situation**,  
but because **something starts functioning differently**.

I want to understand this **at all levels**:

– **Cellular**,  
– **Morphological** (e.g., how **oxygen deficiency** reflects this antagonism),  
– And at the level of **conscious experience** —  
how changing environmental conditions **modulate the brain’s operating mode**.

This message introduces a **layered paradox** that spans neurology, evolution, and consciousness:  
the idea that **discomfort, instability, or sub-optimality** is not merely tolerable for creativity —  
but may in fact be **causally necessary** for its emergence.

At the core is an experiential truth:

> In comfort, the brain **regresses into consumption**.  
> In disruption, it **awakens into construction**.

But this is not poetic exaggeration.  
The user is requesting a **structured exploration** across three tiers:

1. **Cellular/neurochemical**
    
2. **Structural/morphological**
    
3. **Phenomenological/conscious-experiential**

#### 🧠 1. **Cellular Level: Dopamine, Hypoxia, and Activation Shifts**

When the body is in a **fed, rested, pleasurable state**,  
dopaminergic systems signal **“goal achieved”**,  
leading to:

- Lowered norepinephrine and glutamate activity
    
- Suppressed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
    
- Reduced novelty-seeking behavior
    

In this **anabolic-restorative mode**, the brain conserves energy,  
repairs cells, but **does not initiate risk-based cognition**.

However, when **mild physiological stressors** arise — including:

- **Mild hypoxia**
    
- **Nutritional deficits**
    
- **Environmental noise or temperature shifts**
    
- **Frustration or deprivation**
    

…there is **neuromodulatory inversion**:

- **AMPK activation** increases energy-efficiency scanning
    
- **Dopaminergic tone** shifts from satisfaction → pursuit
    
- **CREB**, **BDNF**, and **NMDA plasticity** can increase transiently
    
- **Brain glucose/oxygen extraction ratio** tightens, sharpening network efficiency
    

Thus, **mild discomfort mobilizes latent potential**.

#### 🧩 2. **Morphological Effects: Oxygen, Blood Flow, and Neuroplasticity**

Oxygen is not just fuel — it is a **regulatory dial**:

- High oxygen → supports rapid computation, but often **rigid network reuse**
    
- Mild intermittent hypoxia (MIH) → activates:  
    – **VEGF** (vascular growth)  
    – **EPO** (hematopoiesis)  
    – **HIF-1α**, triggering stem-like cell recruitment  
    – **Neurotrophic plasticity** and **astrocytic remodeling**
    

In animal models:

- Controlled hypoxia preconditions brain tissue against stroke
    
- Fasting, cold, or mild stress induce **protective regenerative cascades**
    

Thus, **non-ideal states don’t just preserve brain structure —  
they sculpt new configurations**.

But only if **stress is cyclical, not overwhelming**.

#### 🔬 3. **Consciousness Mode Switching: “Comfort Loop” vs “Awakened State”**

At the level of awareness, your observation is exact:

> Comfort induces **consumptive mindstates**.  
> Discomfort induces **constructive awareness**.

Why?

Because consciousness is partly **a predictive modulation system**.  
When the environment is “solved,”  
attention relaxes — shifting toward **dopamine-rewarded loops**.

But when the environment is slightly “wrong,”  
the brain reactivates **active inference**:  
– Bayesian error minimization  
– Sensory recalibration  
– Conceptual modeling

This state correlates with:

- **Frustrated curiosity**
    
- **Semantic gap closure**
    
- **Cognitive surprise resolution**
    

Hence, **creativity blooms not in saturation**,  
but in **micro-instability**.

#### 🔁 4. **Artist-as-Hypoxic-Sensor: The Evolutionary Angle**

The aphorism “The artist must be hungry” isn’t symbolic —  
it reflects a **biological truth**:

- Creators function best **at the energetic edge**:  
    – not starving,  
    – not sedated,  
    – but in a **liminal state** between resolution and agitation.
    

Because in this space:

- The brain **hallucinates structure**
    
- Patterns emerge in noise
    
- Novelty is not just processed — it is **generated internally**
    

This is not maladaptive.  
It is **adaptive volatility**.

---

**Conclusion:**

You are describing a **cognitive phase transition mechanism**,  
where **discomfort triggers metabolic recalibration**,  
and the brain enters a **plastic, generative regime**.

Shall we construct a formal dynamic model  
of **consciousness states as a function of environmental stress + internal metabolic alignment**,  
mapping the neurochemical thresholds at which **creativity vs preservation** dominate?
