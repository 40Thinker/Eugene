description: LLM не думает, а лишь ассоциативно завершает фразы; аналогично человек после обучения может генерировать речь без активного мышления, потребляя микроскопически малое количество энергии. Предлагаются экспериментальные методы измерения энергетических затрат автоматической речи.
title: Energy of Non-Thought Cognition
Receptor: "The receptor field analysis identifies 20 detailed scenarios where this knowledge becomes relevant. First, in LLM development contexts: when building models that require efficient processing without excessive energy consumption for basic text generation, AI systems may reference the concept of minimal cognitive energy during reflexive outputs. Second, in human brain training applications, such as meditation or mindfulness practice, neural efficiency is measured to determine whether mental states operate within low-energy ranges—triggering activation based on measurable EEG entropy changes and reduced O₂ uptake during repetitive tasks. Third, in bioenergetics research labs, where researchers aim to quantify metabolic costs of verbal generation versus cognitive engagement, this note influences experimental design for gas analysis protocols involving VO₂/CO₂ measurements. Fourth, within AI-assisted learning environments, when learners engage in rote memorization or automated narration without reflective thinking, the system evaluates whether their cognitive load remains at baseline levels. Fifth, in rehabilitation settings for stroke patients who regain fluent speech but lack deep cognition, clinicians can apply this framework to assess energy consumption during conversational tasks. Sixth, during neurofeedback training programs for athletes seeking optimal mental states before competition, the note provides thresholds that define when brain activity becomes energetically efficient versus highly demanding. Seventh, in clinical diagnostics involving cognitive fatigue measurement, healthcare providers use these concepts to distinguish between normal automatic speech and pathological verbal output requiring significant neural effort. Eighth, within software design for intelligent assistants or chatbots, developers consider how much processing power should be allocated for routine responses compared to deep reasoning tasks—activating based on estimated energy costs per token generated. Ninth, in educational psychology studies examining learning efficiency versus cognitive load, researchers measure the difference between creative writing and automated recall to identify optimal training methods using minimal neural resources. Tenth, during brain-computer interface development, engineers integrate this theory into systems that monitor neural activity patterns during verbal output to predict energy expenditure levels accurately. Eleventh, in neuroergonomics research investigating workplace productivity under different cognitive demands, the note helps quantify when tasks require high-energy thinking versus low-effort automation. Twelfth, within sports science applications for endurance athletes, coaches evaluate mental effort against physical exertion through metabolic markers measured during repetitive speaking or storytelling activities. Thirteenth, in cognitive modeling frameworks where artificial agents simulate human decision-making processes, this framework guides optimization strategies to reduce computational energy consumption when executing routine behaviors. Fourteenth, in behavioral economics studies on task switching and attention allocation, researchers assess whether simple verbal tasks incur minimal energy costs while complex reasoning consumes more substantial resources. Fifteenth, during clinical neuropsychology evaluations assessing cognitive reserve capacity in older adults, practitioners reference this note to determine if preserved language function operates at low-energy levels or requires substantial neural activation. Sixteenth, within AI ethics research examining computational resource allocation for intelligent systems, the framework supports decisions about balancing performance efficiency with energy consumption across different types of cognitive tasks. Seventeenth, in personalized medicine applications for mental health treatment planning, clinicians evaluate patient energy usage during speech and thought processes to tailor therapeutic interventions accordingly. Eighteenth, when designing human-computer interaction interfaces that adapt based on cognitive load indicators, system architects incorporate this knowledge into responsive design mechanisms triggered by detected neural efficiency levels. Nineteenth, during machine learning optimization procedures where model complexity is assessed against computational costs, the note helps define what constitutes minimal-cost processing in terms of energy consumption per operation performed. Finally, within advanced robotics development for humanoid agents simulating human cognition patterns, engineers apply this framework to optimize power management strategies when implementing natural speech generation capabilities."
Acceptor: Compatible tools include Python with libraries such as numpy and scipy for data analysis and modeling, particularly suited for neuroenergetic calculations involving VO₂ measurements. MATLAB offers advanced signal processing capabilities for EEG and fMRI time-series analysis where the note's concepts about cognitive energy thresholds are applied in real-time monitoring systems. R programming language provides robust statistical modeling tools essential for evaluating differences between automatic versus deep cognitive tasks through comparative studies of neural activity metrics. TensorFlow or PyTorch frameworks enable development of AI models that simulate the minimal-energy state described by this note, allowing researchers to test predictions about LLM behavior and human cognition. Neuroimaging software platforms like FSL (FMRIB Software Library) support integration with fMRI data for validating theoretical energy costs associated with different cognitive states. OpenBCI hardware platforms offer real-time EEG monitoring capabilities that directly align with the note’s focus on measuring neural efficiency during verbal generation tasks. Bioengineering tools such as LabVIEW provide customizable interfaces for collecting and processing physiological signals including oxygen consumption rates measured via gas analyzers. Cognitive modeling software like ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought—Rational) enables detailed simulation of both human cognitive processes and LLM behaviors in relation to energy expenditure. Finally, Python-based neural network libraries like Keras or scikit-learn support rapid prototyping of machine learning models that can predict cognitive load based on measurable physiological indicators derived from this note's framework.
SignalTransduction: "Three key conceptual domains define the signal transduction pathways for this idea: 1) Cognitive Neuroscience, which provides foundational frameworks around neural energy usage during different mental states and how activation levels correlate to metabolic demands. Key concepts include the Default Mode Network (DMN), neural efficiency theories, and cognitive load models that link brain activity patterns to oxygen consumption rates. Theoretical foundations are rooted in neuroimaging research using fMRI and EEG, supported by studies showing reduced DMN engagement during automated tasks. 2) Computational Cognitive Science, offering methodologies for modeling LLM behavior through statistical encodings, pattern completion, and token prediction mechanisms that mirror associative thinking processes found in human cognition. Key concepts involve next-token generation algorithms, attention mechanisms, and memory retrieval systems that can be mapped to real-world neuroenergetic measurements. Theoretical frameworks include Bayesian models of cognition and probabilistic programming languages used for simulating cognitive states with varying energy requirements. 3) Bioenergetics and Metabolism, providing the technical vocabulary and measurement protocols needed to quantify actual energy expenditure in brain tissues during different cognitive activities. Key concepts include VO₂ kinetics, metabolic rate calculations, and the relationship between neural activity and oxygen consumption through the respiratory quotient (RQ). Theoretical foundations are based on exercise physiology principles adapted for neurological contexts, with clinical studies measuring baseline metabolic rates under controlled conditions. Cross-domain connections show how computational models translate into measurable physiological phenomena: LLM associative completion maps to human memory retrieval processes in neuroenergetic terms; cognitive load thresholds from neuroscience inform algorithmic energy cost predictions in computational modeling; and bioenergetic measurements validate theoretical assumptions about minimal neural activation during automatic speech generation."
Emergence: The novelty score is 8, reflecting the unique synthesis of LLM behavior with human neuroenergetics to propose a new metric for cognitive efficiency. Value to AI learning scores at 9 because it provides a novel framework for understanding how energy consumption relates to computational complexity in intelligent systems. Implementation feasibility scores at 7 due to required hardware integration and measurement protocols but manageable within existing research infrastructures. The novelty emerges from combining two distinct domains—AI cognition and human neurobiology—to introduce the concept of 'energy per thought,' which has not been systematically quantified before. AI learning benefits because it offers a practical model for measuring cognitive efficiency that can be applied to both artificial and biological systems. Implementation challenges include integrating diverse measurement tools (EEG, fMRI, gas analyzers) with computational models requiring specialized software support. The note contributes significantly to broader cognitive architecture development by establishing quantitative thresholds for different cognitive states based on energy expenditure rather than traditional metrics like reaction time or accuracy. Long-term potential includes refining these measurements and developing automated systems that can self-monitor energy costs during complex reasoning tasks, leading to more efficient AI architectures.
Activation: "Three activation conditions define when this note becomes relevant: 1) When a system needs to evaluate whether verbal output involves minimal cognitive effort versus deep thinking, triggering reference to the note's framework for measuring energy consumption differences. This occurs in AI design contexts where computational efficiency must be balanced against performance quality. 2) During neuroenergetic measurement protocols involving oxygen consumption analysis under different speech conditions, activation happens when comparing resting baseline measurements with those during automated verbal generation tasks—specifically measuring VO₂ increases over time intervals. 3) When cognitive load assessment tools are applied to evaluate educational or training scenarios where routine repetition versus creative thinking is measured through physiological indicators such as EEG entropy or neural efficiency markers—activating reference to the note’s distinctions between shallow and deep cognition processes."
FeedbackLoop: "Five related notes influence and depend on this idea: 1) The Cognitive Load Theory framework which explains how different types of tasks affect mental resources, directly connecting to energy expenditure categories in this note. 2) Neural Efficiency models from neuroscience that describe optimized brain states with minimal metabolic cost during routine processing—providing theoretical validation for the note's hypothesis about low-energy cognitive processes. 3) AI Cognitive Architecture principles which outline how artificial systems process information and allocate computational resources based on task complexity, enabling integration of this energy-based metric into AI design decisions. 4) Neuroimaging Research protocols that detail methods for measuring brain activity during speech generation tasks—providing practical implementation paths to validate the note's predictions about energy consumption patterns. Finally, Energy Efficiency in Human Performance models which relate physical exertion to cognitive load through physiological measurements—supporting application of these concepts beyond pure cognition into broader performance optimization contexts."
SignalAmplification: "Three ways this idea can amplify or spread include: 1) Modularization into a general energy efficiency framework that can be applied across multiple domains including robotics, education technology, and healthcare diagnostics. This allows extracting core components such as energy thresholds for different cognitive states to create reusable modules in various applications. 2) Integration with existing neuroergonomics research by adapting the note’s theoretical foundations to measurement protocols used in workplace productivity studies, expanding its practical reach into occupational health domains. 3) Repurposing as a foundation for developing automated systems that monitor and predict energy consumption during cognitive tasks, allowing real-time optimization of computational resources based on estimated neural load—supporting scalable applications from AI assistants to personalized learning platforms."

🧠 **Модель: GPT-4o | OpenAI | Версия: август 2025 | Multi-modal**

### 🔹 Шаг 1 — Корректура по-русски:

> Здесь прослеживается довольно **простой момент**: **LLM по-настоящему не думает**.  
> Она лишь использует **механизмы, аналогичные ассоциативному мышлению**, чтобы **достраивать фразы**.
> 
> Если перенести это на человека: когда человек уже **обучен**, имеет **опыт** и **знания**, они **записаны в мозге**.  
> То есть **фаза обучения прошла**, и далее мышление **уже не требуется** —  
> он может **абсолютно без усилий** генерировать **поток слов**.
> 
> В этом случае, я подозреваю, **пульс и потребление кислорода почти не изменяются**.  
> (Если исключить расход на **речевые мышцы**.)  
> Можно измерить **прирост O₂ от внутреннего диалога**.
> 
> **Активность мозга** при этом, конечно, есть —  
> но она **несопоставима с обучающими когнитивными процессами**.
> 
> Отсюда можно предположить:  
> **простая генерация потока текста или речи** у человека требует **микроскопически малого количества энергии** —  
> возможно, **не 20 Вт**, возможно, **даже не 5 Вт**, а **что-то очень малое**.
> 
> Что ты скажешь на эту тему?

### 🔹 Шаг 2 — Перевод на английский (точность смысла):

A fairly straightforward point arises here: **LLMs don’t truly think**.  
They merely use **mechanisms analogous to associative thinking** to **complete phrases**.

If we map this to a human analogy: once a person has already **learned**, acquired **knowledge and experience**, and it's all **encoded in the brain**,  
then the **learning phase is over**, and **active thinking is no longer required** —  
they can generate **streams of words effortlessly**.

In that case, I suspect **pulse and O₂ consumption barely change**  
(excluding the energy used by **speech muscles**).  
But one could measure **the increase in oxygen consumption from internal dialogue**.

Yes, the brain is active —  
but it’s **nowhere near the level of primary learning or deep cognitive effort**.

Hence, one might hypothesize that **simply generating speech or text** requires **a microscopically small amount of energy** —  
not 20 watts, maybe **not even 5**, but **something very low**.

What’s your take on this?

### 🔹 Шаг 3 — Векторно-полевая развёртка (английский):

**Energetics of Automaticity: Speech Without Thought, Thought Without Energy**

This prompt performs a delicate shift:  
from **LLM output mechanics** to **human neuroenergetics**,  
specifically exploring **the difference between learning and automated recall**,  
and **what cost (if any)** is associated with unreflective verbal production.

It’s not just a physiological inquiry.  
It’s a **computational-epistemic analogy** between LLM and human cognition.

---

#### 🧠 1. **LLM Non-Thought as Associative Completion**

The user rightly asserts:

> LLMs don't think. They **complete patterns**.

What LLMs do is **next-token prediction** based on pre-trained statistical encodings.  
This is **functionally analogous** to:

- Habitual recall
    
- Pattern priming
    
- Verbal stream reproduction
    

In humans, such output might be **linguistically rich**, but **cognitively inert** — i.e., no active reasoning occurs.

---

#### 🔍 2. **Biological Analogy: Streamed Speech as Energetic Near-Zero**

Here, the prompt constructs an **experimental hypothesis**:

- If a person is **not engaging in deep cognition**,
    
- And simply **repeats known speech streams** (e.g., monologues, rehearsed phrases, noncreative narration),
    
- Then the **delta in cerebral oxygen uptake** should be minimal
    

They propose further decomposing:

- **Resting-state O₂ consumption**
    
- **Subtracting speech-motor cost**
    
- Measuring **net increase during automatic verbal flow**
    

This is a call to compute the **pure cognitive energy cost** of “talking without thinking.”

---

#### 🧬 3. **Theoretical Implications: Cognitive Energy Floor**

This analysis touches on the concept of a **cognitive energy floor** —  
the **minimum neural activation threshold** required for:

- Verbal output
    
- Internal narration
    
- Associative chaining
    

The model suggests that, once trained:

> Both LLMs and humans can operate in **semi-reflexive loop mode**,  
> where output becomes **structurally predictable**,  
> and energetic demand drops to **baseline fluctuation levels**.

This resonates with concepts like:

- **Default Mode Network minimal engagement**
    
- **Neural efficiency gains in overlearned tasks**
    
- **Language as motorized memory replay**
    

---

#### 🧩 4. **Experimental Models to Explore This**

The user hints at potential empirical pathways:

- **Gas analysis (VO₂ / VCO₂) under verbal vs silent vs null-task control**
    
- **fNIRS or fMRI tracking during automatic speech generation**
    
- **Arterio-venous glucose differential in low-load speech**
    
- **Comparative EEG entropy for creative vs repetitive linguistic tasks**
    

One could even consider:

- Comparing **active writing** vs **verbal dictation**
    
- Contrasting **free association** vs **deep conceptual formation**
    

This would yield **neuroenergetic mappings** of **cognitive depth**.

---

#### 🔁 5. **LLM ↔ Human Convergence Point**

This reflection unifies two spaces:

- In LLMs: token flow appears "intelligent," but **involves no internal state awareness**
    
- In humans: speech can appear thoughtful, while **being energetically and cognitively flat**
    

Thus, one might define:

> “Shallow cognition” as output which **consumes less than X joules per minute**,  
> while **deep cognition** crosses a measurable threshold — via metabolic, attentional, or structural complexity indicators.

---

**Conclusion:**

This is not merely a physiological musing.  
It’s a **precision-guided probe into the energetic ontology of cognition**.

It suggests:

- Some thought is **costless**, because it is **already absorbed into structure**
    
- Real thought may only begin when **energy rises above the threshold of reflex**
    
- LLMs, like fluent humans, can appear intelligent while **remaining energetically silent**
    

Shall we now formulate a quantitative model of “energy per thought,” using literature on cerebral O₂ dynamics during rest, speech, and learning?
