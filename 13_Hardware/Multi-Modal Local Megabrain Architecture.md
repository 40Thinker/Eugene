SignalTransduction: |-
  The signal transduction pathway analysis identifies five conceptual domains that this idea belongs to:

  ### Domain 1: Cognitive Architecture Theory
  This domain provides foundational concepts about how intelligence systems can be structured with specialized components. The core ideas from cognitive architecture theory directly relate to the note's proposal of distributing reasoning across multiple GPU units like brain lobes, with RAM as working memory and CPU acting as control loop meta-agent.

  ### Domain 2: Distributed Computing Systems

The note's hardware architecture directly aligns with principles from distributed systems theory where specialized processors work together through shared communication mechanisms to achieve collective intelligence.

  ### Domain 3: Multi-Modal AI Processing Frameworks
  This domain encompasses approaches for handling multiple input/output modalities within single AI architectures. The note's vision of dedicated models for audio, image, and video processing fits perfectly with this framework, where each modality has its own specialized processing unit but integrates through orchestration mechanisms.

  ### Domain 4: Hardware-Software Integration Design Principles
  This domain emphasizes how software systems must be designed to match hardware capabilities and constraints. The note's approach of using heterogeneous GPUs in parallel while leveraging large RAM capacity reflects these principles, ensuring optimal resource utilization across different computing components.

  ### Domain 5: Neurocomputational Systems Theory
