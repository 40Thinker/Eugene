SignalTransduction: |-
  The signal transduction pathway analysis identifies five conceptual domains that this idea belongs to:

  ### Domain 1: Cognitive Architecture Theory
  This domain provides foundational concepts about how intelligence systems can be structured with specialized components. The core ideas from cognitive architecture theory directly relate to the note's proposal of distributing reasoning across multiple GPU units like brain lobes, with RAM as working memory and CPU acting as control loop meta-agent.

## Мысли для инженера

Для успешного понимания и реализации этой архитектуры инженеру следует обратить внимание на следующие ключевые аспекты:

1. **Понимание структуры оркестрации**: Важно глубоко изучить, как работает n8n для управления потоками данных между различными моделями и компонентами системы [^16]. Это основа координации распределённого интеллекта.

2. **Распределение ресурсов по модальностям**: Нужно понять, как эффективно распределять нагрузку между GPU (NVIDIA RTX 6000 для тяжёлых моделей), Radeon (для лёгких) и RAM-моделями. Ключевым моментом является оптимизация памяти при работе с эфемерными данными [^17].

3. **Встраивание символических систем**: Использование фреймворков, таких как Hugging Face Transformers или LangChain, для создания символических слоёв, которые могут управлять поведением моделей через внешние логические протоколы [^18].

4. **Создание экосистемы периферийных моделей**: Определение и реализация специализированных моделей для различных типов данных (аудио, видео, изображения) требует понимания их конкретной архитектуры и способов интеграции в общую систему [^19].

5. **Работа с данными на уровне потоков**: Системы должны эффективно обрабатывать реальные данные через Kafka для обеспечения непрерывного потока информации между компонентами [^20].

8. **Разработка архитектурного подхода к "семантической резонансной" связи**: Система должна быть способна создавать «семантические резонансы» между различными моделями, поддерживая согласованность и глубину рассуждений [^23].

9. **Понимание контекста когнитивной архитектуры**: Связь с концепцией «мозговой структуры» — это не просто сравнение с биологическим мозгом, а полное понимание того, как распределённые компоненты могут работать вместе как единая система мышления [^24].

10. **Написание и тестирование системных правил**: Необходимо создавать четкие правила для взаимодействия между различными частями мегамозга, чтобы обеспечить согласованность и предсказуемость поведения системы [^25].
