# Major Problems That Current AI Architectures Cannot Solve

This document lists the fundamental problems that existing AI architectures cannot address, drawing from various schools of AI development over the past 80 years.

## 1. Self-Evolution During Operation
Current AI systems cannot autonomously modify their own architecture or learning strategies while working:
- No capability for self-improvement mechanisms that adapt continuously during operation
- Limited ability to create new problem-solving approaches on-the-fly without external intervention
- Inability to evolve internal algorithms or reasoning patterns in real-time

## 2. One-Shot Learning Like Humans
Modern AI systems require extensive training data for even simple tasks:
- Cannot learn complex concepts from single examples with high generalization capability
- Lack of ability to form new concepts based on partial information
- Limited transfer learning between domains without substantial retraining

## 3. Absence of World Model
Current architectures lack comprehensive internal representation of the world:
- No dynamic causal relationships between events or entities
- Inability to maintain long-term temporal consistency
- Limited abstract reasoning about entities and their properties
- Difficulty in integrating knowledge across multiple domains

This prevents true understanding rather than just pattern matching.

## 4. Hallucination Problems
AI systems frequently generate false information without confidence estimation:
- No mechanisms to distinguish between known facts and generated content
- Inability to assess the reliability of claims made during reasoning
- Lack of internal verification processes for statements produced

## 5. Memory Limitations
Current AI lacks persistent memory across sessions:
- Short-term memory constraints that prevent long-term knowledge retention
- No capability to maintain context over extended conversations or tasks
- Difficulty in building upon previous experiences and insights

## 6. Absence of Meta-Cognitive Abilities
AI systems lack introspective awareness about their own thinking processes:
- Cannot evaluate the quality or reliability of their own reasoning
- Limited self-assessment capabilities
- No ability to monitor and adjust problem-solving strategies autonomously

## 7. Inability for Self-Supervision
Current AI cannot effectively regulate its own behavior without external constraints:
- Lack of internal safety mechanisms that can prevent harmful outputs
- Cannot detect when reasoning has failed or become unreliable
- Limited capacity for autonomous decision-making about behavioral boundaries

These limitations fundamentally constrain AI systems from achieving true intelligence and autonomy.
